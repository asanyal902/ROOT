<h3>Core</h3>
<h4>ACLiC</h4>
<ul>
<li>Allow ACLiC to use a flat directory structure when a build directory is specified.
To use a flat structure do:
<pre style="border:gray 1px solid;padding:0.5em 2em;background:#ffe">
   gSystem->SetBuildDir(whereIwant, kTRUE); // the default for the 2nd parameter is kFALSE
</pre>
Or use '-' in the option of CompileMacro
<pre style="border:gray 1px solid;padding:0.5em 2em;background:#ffe">
   gSystem->CompileMacro(myscript,"k-",...);
</pre>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Meta</h4>
<ul>
<li>Implement polymorphism for Emulated object (still not supporting polymorphism
of Emulated Object inheriting from compiled class).</p>
This avoids memory leaks when the user data model relies on polymorphism
and does not the shared library defining the classes theand avoid splicing if the data is copied.

</p>
<tt>TStreamerInfo::New</tt> inserts the address of the creating <tt>TStreamerInfo</tt> into
the object.  This address is inserted in each emulated that does not inherit
from an emulated class and is positioned after all the base classes (which
are compiled classes).   A derived class will set this value inside each
of its emulated base class.
</p>
<tt>TStreamerInfo::Destruct</tt> and the new method <tt>TStreamerInfo::GetActualClass</tt>
use this information to detect the TStreamerInfo actually used to create
the object and hence run the proper emulated destructor.

</li>
</ul>
