<h3>Platform Support</h3>

<p>Temorarily for version 6.00/00, ROOT has a reduced set of supported platforms.
Most notably Windows is not supported until at least 6.02.
6.00/00 supports only</p>
<ul>
<li>Linux 32bit and 64 bit, i32 and x86-64 and x32 (see below). Likely also PPC but that is untested, please report.</li>
<li>MacOS on Intel CPUs.</li>
</ul>
<p>More platforms are expected to be available later; the lack of support stems from cling not being ported to these platforms yet.</p>

<p>Despite that, an additional platform as been added: the <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/x32abi/">x32 psAPI</a>, called linuxx32gcc.
It is a regular x86-64 ABI but with shorter pointers (4 bytes instead of 8).
This reduces the addressable memory per process to 4GB - but that is usally sufficient.
The advantages are reduced memory consumption (due to the smaller pointers) and increased performance compared to 32bit applications due to the availability of the 64bit instructions.
The clang developers mailing list archive <a href="http://clang-developers.42468.n3.nabble.com/Re-PATCH-add-x32-psABI-support-td4024297.html">contains a good comparison.</a></p>

<p>To build and run binaries compiled in x32, toolchain support is needed. That is available in the in binutils (2.22), GCC (4.7), glibc (2.16), Linux kernel (3.4) and even GDB (7.5).
These versions are not available in regular distributions yet (except for <a href="http://dev.gentoo.org/~vapier/x32/stage3-amd64-x32-20120605.tar.xz"> this beta Gentoo distro</a> built in x32); once they are, building and running x86-64 and x32 side-by-side will be possible.</p>

<h3>Core Libraries</h3>

<h4>Cling vs CINT</h4>

Cling follows the C++ standard much more strictly than CINT.   In
particular some code that used to run with CINT will either issue
new warnings or new compilations error.

For example when CINT was parsing Namespace::Symbol it would not
only apply the C++ search rules but also search in the outer
scopes and for this example could actually return ::Symbol instead
of (as Cling now does) issuing a compilation error.

Cling no longer supports refering to a class template instantiation
of a class template that has all default template parameter without
the &lt;&gt;. With:
<pre>template &lt;typename T = int&gt; class vec {};</pre>.  With Cling
(and any standard compliant compiler), using <em>vec&lt;&gt;</em>
is allowed (but <em>vec</em> is not).

<h4>Cling not yet implemented features</h4>

In this release Cling does not support the following (but we intended
to re-introduce them soon) features:

<ul><li>Unloading of script and shared libraries</li>
    <li>Discovery of symbols that are declared but not implemented
    being delayed until run-time. I.e.
<pre>void foo();
void run() { dlopen("foo.so"); foo(); }</pre>does not work in this release.</li>
</ul>

<h4>TInterpreter</h4>

The following are no longer supported and are now only issuing error
messages:
<ul><li>Getgvp</li>
    <li>Setgvp</li>
    <li>SetRTLD_NOW</li>
    <li>SetRTLD_LAZY</li>
</ul>

Use of Setgvp and Getgvp should be looked at carefully as they were
use to control the behavior of the multiplexing CINT wrappers that
were both wrapper the calls to operator new with and without placement
and the constructor (and similarly for operator delete and the
destructor).  Cling does not support such a multiplexing wrapper and
alternatively interface must be used (See TClass::New and
TClass::Destructor for example).

<h4>rootcling</h4>

rootcling is the successor to rootcint and genreflex. It is used to implement 
backward compatibility wrappers for both of them with the following <em>backward
incompatibilities.</em>
<ul>
  <li>rootcling does not support multiline #pragma without a line
continuation as rootcint did (rootcint support #pragma link with a line
continutation only in ROOT v5.34/02 and above).</li>
  <li>rootcling no longer re-#defines the private and protected keywords to public.
In particular this means that code compiled as part of the dictionary no longer
has access to protected and private members of a class (except where allowed
by the C++ standard).</li>
  <li>rootcling no longer considers a friend declaration to be a
declaration for the friended function.  In particular this means that
rootcling may now issue:
<pre>Error: in this version of ROOT, the option '!' used in a linkdef file
       implies the actual existence of customized operators.
       The following declaration is now required:
   TBuffer &amp;operator&lt;&lt;(TBuffer &amp;,const THit *);
</pre>if the operator&lt;&lt; declaration is missing.</li>
</ul>
To steer the parsing done during the execution of rootcling, a new macro:
<em>__ROOTCLING__</em> is now defined during the parsing.  The macros
<em>__CINT__</em> and <em>__MAKECINT__</em> are defined only when looking
for <tt>#pragma</tt> statement.

<h4>ACliC</h4>

ACLiC has the following backward incompatibilities:
<ul>
   <li>Since rootcling no longer re-#defines the private and protected keyword to public,
the code compiled by ACLIC no longer
has access to protected and private members of a class (except where allowed
by the C++ standard).</li>
</ul>

<h4>TUnixSystem</h4>
<ul>
   <li> Simplify <tt>Setenv</tt> coding.</li>
   <li> Implement <tt>Unsetenv</tt> using the system function <tt>unsetenv</tt>.
   </li>
</ul>

<h4>TColor</h4>
<ul>
   <li>
      5 new predefined palettes with 255 colors are available vis
      <tt>gStyle->SetPalette(n)</tt>:
      <ul>
      <li> n = 51 a Deep Sea palette is used.</li>
      <li> n = 52 a Grey Scale palette is used.</li>
      <li> n = 53 a Dark Body Radiator palette is used.</li>
      <li> n = 54 a two-color hue palette palette is used.(dark blue through neutral gray to bright yellow)</li>
      <li> n = 55 a Rain Bow palette is used.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><img src="pal255.png" alt="New 255 colors palettes"/></p>
   </li>
   <li>
   Add the optional parameter "alpha" to <tt>TColor::SetPalette</tt> and 
   <tt>TStyle::SetPalette</tt>. The default value is 1. (opaque palette).
   Any value between 0. and 1 define the level of transparency. 0. being fully
   transparent and 1. fully opaque.</li>
</ul>

<h4>TColor</h4>
<ul>
   <li>
      In <tt>SaveAS</tt> implement the possibility to save an object as C code
      independant from ROOT. It is enough to save the object in a file with the
      extension ".cc". The code as to save each objet should be implement in
      each <tt>SavePrimitive</tt> function like in <tt>TF1</tt>.
   </li>
</ul>
