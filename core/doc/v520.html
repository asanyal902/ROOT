Class TMessageHandler derives now from TQObject and does emit signals.
This allows for easier usage of this class.

In this release xrootd and libAfterImage are managed in Subversion
via so called "vendor branches". This is completely transparent
except for people who do directly use svn. You will get the message:
<pre>
   $ svn up
   svn: Failed to add directory 'xrootd/src/xrootd': object of the same name already exists
   $ rm -rf xrootd/src/xrootd
   $ svn up
   svn: Failed to add directory 'asimage/src/libAfterImage': object of the same name already exists
   $ rm -rf asimage/src/libAfterImage
   $ svn up
</pre>
</li>
<li>
Port to gcc 4.3 RC1. This version of gcc is much stricker with respect to
implicit header files so in many source files <stdlib.h> and <string.h>
had to be added.
</li>
<li>
  with ACLIC, Remove double dash (//) from the filename passed to cint and rootcint.
</li>
