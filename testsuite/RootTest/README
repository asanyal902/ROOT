The directory RootTest of the TMVA unit test suite contains the script that 
transforms the unit tests suite and its stressTest into a standalone, one-file 
Program that only requires ROOT libraries. The file itself is approximately 
2.5k lines of code and behaves exactly like the short, non-verbose stressTest 
of the full TMVA unit test suite

To create the standalone programe use the makefile
The command "make" creates stressTMVA.cxx using the script buildRootTest.sh.
It also creates an executable.
