# PROOF config file. It has a very simple format:
#
# node <hostname> [image=<imagename>]
# slave <hostname> [perf=<perfindex>] [image=<imagename>] [port=<portnumber>]
#                  [usrpwd | srp | krb5 | globus | ssh | uidgid]
# user <username> on <hostname>
#
# For each unique node in the cluster add a "node" line.
# For each node in the cluster that can run a slave server add a "slave" line.
# A single node can run multiple slaves (e.g. an SMP machine). In that case
# repeat the slave line N times, where N is the number of CPU's in the machine.
# Perfindex is a number specifying the relative speed of each slave CPU in the
# cluster. Say, the fastest CPU is 100, a CPU 30% slower has perf=70. The
# perfindex is used for load balancing. By default perf=100. The perfindex
# is mostly an indication since the parallel algorithm is adaptive and will
# adjust itself to the current load on each machine.
# Image is used to tell the system that system images are shared between
# nodes/CPU's in the cluster. For example if all nodes share a common user
# directory, like with AFS, set image=afs (<imagename> is arbitrary but should
# be unique for each different image). By default imagename is the hostname.
# Port is used to tell PROOF to connect to the slave servers on the specified
# port (in case proofd was started by the user as opposed to via inetd).
# Srp is used to tell PROOF to use the SRP (Secure Remote Password) protocol
# to authenticate to the slaves. If this flag is set it is necessary that
# on the master server there is a file ~/.rootnetrc with the needed login
# information and that on the slaves the file ~/.srootdpass exists.
# Krb5 is used to tell PROOF to use Kerberos5 to authenticate the slaves.
# 
# Users can be redirected to have their master server run on a predetermined
# node. For that use the "user" line.
