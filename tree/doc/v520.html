<p>
Re-enabled the splitting of TVector3 and of any classes starting by TVector
that is not a TVectorT.
<p>
Fix the list of StreamerInfo stored in the TFile in the case of a slow
CloneTree, previously some of the classes whose named contained '::' and any
of the STL container names was inadvertently omitted (in case of classes
that are part of the TTree but had only a base and no member or in some
cases where it had only object data members.
<p>
Prevent storing a 2nd time an object non derived from TObject in the case
where the object is <em>both</em> the top level object of branch and has
some of it sub-object containing a pointer back to the object.  (This was
actually activate in v5.18).

<h4>STL collections with pointers can be split</h4>
<pre>
 TBranch *branch = tree->Branch( branchname, STLcollection, buffsize, splitlevel )
 </pre>
<p>
STLcollection is the address of a pointer to std::vector, std::list,
         std::deque, std::set or std::multiset containing pointers to objects.
         If the splitlevel is a value bigger than 100 then the collection
         will be written in split mode. Ie. if it contains objects of any
         types deriving from TTrack this function will sort the objects
         basing on their type and store them in separate branches in split
         mode.
<p>The ROOT test example in ROOTSYS/test/bench.cxx shows many examples of collections
and storage in a TTree when using split mode or not. This program illustrates the important
gain in space and time when using this new facility.
