<h3>Tree</h3>
<ul>
<li>In TTree and TChain LoadTree fReadEntry is now set to -1 in case of failure to find the proper row.</li>
<li>In TTree::CloneTree, TChain::Merge and TTree::CopyEntries introduces more flexibility
in the handling of the case where a TTreeIndex is 'missing' in one or more of the 
TTree objects being collated.   If the tree or any of the underlying tree of the chain has an index, 
that index and any index in the subsequent underlying TTree objects will be merged. There are currently three 'options' 
to control this merging:
   <ul>
   <li>NoIndex             : all the TTreeIndex object are dropped.</li>
   <li>DropIndexOnError    : if any of the underlying TTree object do no have a TTreeIndex,
                             they are all dropped.</li>
   <li>AsIsIndexOnError [default]: In case of missing TTreeIndex, the resulting TTree index has gaps.</li>
   <li>BuildIndexOnError : If any of the underlying TTree object do no have a TTreeIndex,
                           all TTreeIndex are 'ignored' and the mising piece are rebuilt.</li>
   </ul>
   Previously the index were kept only if the first files had an index and if there was any missing index,
   the resulting index had gaps (the default was similar to AsIsIndexOnError).   The new default is BuildIndexOnError  ; i.e.
we now attempt by default to build the missing indices.
</li>
<li>Update MakeProxy so that the resulting skeleton is useable with Proof.</li>
<li>Correct and clarify the relationship between AutoFlush and AutoSave:
   <ul>
   <li>Both the AutoFlush and AutoSave interval can be specified in
terms of bytes (a negative value for fAutoFlush or fAutoSave)
or in terms of the number of entries (positive values).</li>
   <li>An AutoFlush is always done with an AutoSave.</li>
   <li>If the interval specified for AutoSave is less than that for
AutoFlush, the AutoSave interval is used for both.</li>
   <li>If the AutoFlush interval is less than the AutoSave interval,
the AutoSave interval is adjusted to the largest integer
multiple of the AutoFlush interval that is less than or equal
to the original value of the AutoSave interval.</li>
   </ul>
</li>
<li>Add support for 'array' formula in TTree::Query.</li>
<li>Set the initial value of fCacheSize to zero to indicate clearly that the TreeCache is disabled.</li>
<li>In TChain::SetEntryList use only the treename to lookup the (sub)entryList (instead subdir/treename).</li>
<li>And many other bug fixes, security fixes, thread safety and performance improvements ; see the svn log for details.</li>
</ul>
<h4>TTree Scan and Draw</h4>
<ul>
<li>Insured that the generated histogram as an integral bin width when plotting a string or integer.</li>
<li>Improved the output of TTree::Scan by inserting a blank space whenever a value is not available because there is no proper row in a friend.
(Previously it was re-printing the previous value).  This required changes in </li>
