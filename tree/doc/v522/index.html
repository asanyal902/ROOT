<h3>Tree</h3>
<ul>
<li>Restore support for IsAutoDelete in a TBranchElement (IsAutoDelete is an explicit request by the user to have the object deleted/newed each time GetEntry is called)</li>
<li>Allow .root in the name of directory in TChain::Add and TChain::AddFile (however in this case the root file must be ending .root)</li>
<li>Improve support for <i>circular</i> TTree friendship in LoadTree</li>
<li>Insure that the in-memory tree (not attached to a file) are saved in their new style (i.e. each basket saved separately) and prevent the printing of the misleading error message:
<pre>Error in : Cannot create key without file </pre></li>
<li>Repaired TTreeSQL:
The existing code was not compatible with the change made in TTree to reduce the number of baskets in memory.</li>

<li>If the TreeFriend is entered via a TTree*, properly detect that it is in the same file and do _not_ record the filename (since we will alway know where to find it.)ÃŸ</li>
<li>Add "," in the list of special characters replaced by "_" in the TTree::MakeClass
and TTree::MakeCode functions.</li>

</ul>
