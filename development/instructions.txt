### first, make sure the HEAD of TMVA-SVN is what we want in the ROOT release !
### so if it is Friday night, think again and wait until Saturday morning !
### also make sure that the latest changes that happen at ROOT are applied to TMVA

### this is a temporary directory in which we will create all necessary files for Rene
mkdir TMVAintoROOT; cd TMVAintoROOT 


### we compile against the head of root
svn co http://root.cern.ch/svn/root/trunk root


### Now get the SVN-HEAD of TMVA
svn co https://tmva.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/tmva/trunk/TMVA

### now the files from TMVA are copied over two ROOT/tmva (src/inc/test dirs)
### ( if you think something is missing, please modify the script 'makeROOTpackage.sh'
### so that it is fixed for the next time )
./TMVA/development/makeROOTpackage.sh ./rootdev
. ./TMVA/development/createRootPatch.sh



# now is the time to compile and
# make sure it works
. ./TMVA/development/applyPatch.sh
cd root
./configure
make all-tmva

# only if this was successful one should go ahead

### TMVAintoROOT/tmvaPatches.tar has to be sent to Rene
