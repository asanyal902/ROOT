Future developments for TMVA
----------------------------

General (framework, or for all methods):

  - finalise category classifier
    todo: include regression, describe in users guide
  - cross validation (generalised) inclusing self-optimisation of methods (Helge, Joerg)
  - multiclass classification (Peter)
  - 'brut-force' ranking
  - preprocessing for subsets of variables only (note: subset*s*)
  - better GUI, generally improved analysis scripts
  - real test suit + nightly validation and error reporting

...less clear:

  - regression including calibration (?)
  - tie TMVA to RooFit, eg, use of RooAbsPdf in Likelihood (?)
  - integration of systematic errors ?

Method-specific:

  - bayesian neural network (Jan)
  - evolutionary algorithm (Peter)
  - unsupervised learning (bump hunting)
