<h4>TFileMerger</h4>
<ul>
<li>Added possibility to merge only a list of objects/folders from the input files, specified by name,  
<br />or to skip them from merging. This is fully integrated with the new PartialMerge(flags) schema.
<br/>
	Usage:
	<br />The names of the objects to be merged or skipped have to be specified using the interface:
	<pre>
	   TFileMerger::AddObjectNames(const char *names)
	</pre>
	This method can be called several times to add object names. Several names can be added with one
	call separated by single blancs (no blanc at the end). Directory names are accepted, applying the
	merging selection to all content.
	Two new options are being supported for partial merging:
	<pre>
	   <i>TFileMerger::PartialMerge</i><b>(flags | kOnlyListed)</b>
	</pre>
   This will merge only the objects in the files having the names in the specified list. If a folder is 
   specified, it whole content will be merged	
   <pre>
	    <i>TFileMerger::PartialMerge</i><b>(flags | kSkipListed)</b>  
   </pre>
   This will skip merging for the specified objects. If a folder is specified, its whole content will be skipped
<pre>
	Important note:
	The kOnlyListed and kSkipListed flags have to be bitwise OR-ed 
	on top of the merging defaults: kAll | kIncremental (as in the example $ROOTSYS/tutorials/io/mergeSelective.C)
</pre>
</li>
</ul>
