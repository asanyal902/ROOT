<h4>TFileMerger</h4>
<ul>
<li>Added possibility to merge only a list of objects/folders from the input files, specified by name,  
<br />or to skip them from merging. This is fully integrated with the new PartialMerge(flags) schema.</li>
<p>
	Usage:
	<br />The names of the objects to be merged or skipped have to be specified using the interface:
	<pre>
	   <i>TFileMerger::AddObjectNames(const char *names)</i>
	</pre>
	This method can be called several times to add object names. Several names can be added with one
	<br />call separated by single blancs (no blanc at the end). Directory names are accepted, applying the
	<br />merging selection to all content.
</p>
	Two new options are being supported for partial merging:
	<pre>
	   <i>TFileMerger::PartialMerge</i><b>(flags | kOnlyListed)</b>
	</pre>
   This will merge only the objects in the files having the names in the specified list. If a folder is 
   <br />specified, it whole content will be merged	
   <pre>
	    <i>TFileMerger::PartialMerge</i><b>(flags | kSkipListed)</b>  
   </pre>
   This will skip merging for the specified objects. If a folder is specified, its whole content will be skipped
<p>
	<pre><b>Important note:</b></pre>
	The kOnlyListed and kSkipListed flags have to be bitwise OR-ed 
	<br />on top of the merging defaults: kAll | kIncremental (as in the example $ROOTSYS/tutorials/io/mergeSelective.C)
</p>
</ul>
