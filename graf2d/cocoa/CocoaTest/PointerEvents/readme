Pointer tests.

TEST1: crossing events without any grabs, only one top-level window.

Move into 4 from screen:
Enter notify for 4

Move from 4 to 5 and 6 (overlapping part):

Leave notify 4
Enter notify 5
Enter notify 6 (order of enter notify events is different with TGCocoa)

Move again to 4 (from overlapping part):

Leave notify 6
Leave notify 5
Enter notify 4

Press button in 4:

Leave notify 4

Move to 6 (overlapping part):

No events reported (implicit grab on 'root').

Release button:

Enter notify 4
Enter notify 5
Enter notify 6 (we "jumped" from implicitly grabbed 'root') - order can be different with
TGCocoa
