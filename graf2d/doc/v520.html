<h3>TASImage - libAfterImage library</h3>

<h4>TASImage</h4>
<ul>
<li> Protection added in DrawCircle. Problem seen with gcc version 4.2.3.

<li> Fixed byte swapping issues.
With that fix the pictures generated in batch mode on Solaris and
Mac are now correct (cf stressGraphics -k).
<li> The Alpha Blending code has been rewritten in a simpler way in
order to work on linux
with gcc 4.2.3. Here also the pictures generated in batch mode
were wrong.
<li> In FillRectangleInternal when the rectangle to be drawn had
its width or its height equal to 0, they were set to the current image width ot
height. This
was not a good solution because this obscured completly the
picture. In
particular, some markers being drawn with a filled rectangle,
they obscured
the picture when that were really small because in that case the
rectangle
drawn had width=height=0. Now, when a rectangle has its width or
height
equal to 0 it is set to 1 (pixel) with makes sense because &quot;0&quot;
means tiny not
huge ...
</ul>

<h4>libAfterImage</h4>
<ul>
<li>
There no need anymore for the special version we had up to now.
The modifications we needed have been introduced in the official
version.
<p>
This version also fixes the color problem on BigEndian machines.
On these machines
(Mac and Solaris for instance) the color of the jpeg and png
images saved from the
&quot;File&quot; menu in a TCanvas were completely wrong.
</ul>



<h3>Graphical Output</h3>
<h4>PDF</h4>
<ul>
<li> Text rotated at 270 degrees was not correct. The PDF rotation matrix 
     contained very small values close to 0 instead of 0. Acrobat reader
     produced a wrong output and also printed result was wrong.
     &quot;gv&quot; worked.
</ul>
<h4>PostScript</h4>
<ul>
<li> The character &quot;@&quot; could not be printed in PostScript files.
<li> Change the Page numbering to make it appear nicer in postcript viewers
     like gv. It is compliant with the Adobe Postscript Document
     Structuring Conventions (easily found on the web).
</ul>


<h3>TPad</h3>
<ul>
<li> In batch mode it was not possible to generate a bitmap file (gif,
     jpeg etc..) with a filename containing &quot;)&quot;, &quot;(&quot;, &quot;]&quot; or &quot;[&quot;.
<li> The Tickx and Tixky attributes were not saved properly by SavePrimitive.
<li> PaintPolyLineNDC was not working in case of PS output.
<li> In ExecuteEvent. A problem was found Mathieu de Naurois &lt;denauroi@in2p3.fr&gt;.
     It can be reproduced by the following sequence:
     <ol>
     <li> do TCanvas c
     <li> do c-&gt;Divide(2,2)
     <li> show the toolbar
     <li> click L to enter text
     <li> click on a pad to enter text
     <li> move the mouse without releasing the button.
     <li> entex text
     <li> hit Enter.
     </ol>
     Before this bug fix, the canvas position changed on &quot;hit Enter&quot;.
<li> On a Windows dual core machine, the WaitPrimitive call returned
     immediately.
</ul>


<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>

<h4>TView3D</h4>
Protection was missing in ctors in case gPad does not exits.

<h4>TMultiGraph</h4>
<ul>
<p><li> Joining two multigraphs using <tt>In TMultiGraph::Add(TMultiGraph*,Option_t *)</tt>
        method issued the error:
        <pre>
        Error in <TList::AddLast>: argument is a null pointer
        </pre>
        Despite of the message the joined multigraph was correct.
        Internally the loop on the input multigraph was one step too long.
<p><li> Implement the fit parameters painting.
</ul>


<h4>Histograms painting with option BOX</h4>
<ul>
<li> For 2D histograms, when all the bins' contents were negative, the boxes
     were not painted correctly.
<li> For 3D histograms painted using OpenGL (drawing options "glbox" and 
     "glbox1") a minus sign on negative bins is added in order to  
     distinguish them from positive bins.
</ul>

<h4>TGraph2D</h4>
The operator "=" was not correct.

<h4>TPie</h4>
Add the <tt>TPie::GetEntries()</tt> method that return the number slices.
(Guido Volpi)

<h4>TPaletteAxis</h4>
Attributes are now accessible in the context menu.
(requested by Mathieu de Naurois &lt;denauroi@in2p3.fr&gt;)


<h4>TPolyLine</h4>
Implement the possibility to draw TPolyLine in NDC coordinates
(it was partially done but the code was not used).

<h4>Documentation</h4>
<ul>
<li> Better comments in THelix. 
<li> Option &quot;FUNC&quot; was not documented in THistPainter..
<li> Update the help for animated gif generation in TPad.
</ul>


<h4>TCutG</h4>
The graphical cuts applied on histograms did not work when the cut name
contained a mix of lower and upper case characters. This problem occured because
the option used to draw an histogram was always converted into lower case before
begin stored in a pad (in Draw and DrawCopy). Now in Draw() and DrawCopy() the
AppendPad() procedure is called with the option string not converted in lower
case.
