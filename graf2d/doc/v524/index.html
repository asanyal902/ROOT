<h3>Graphical Output</h3>

<h4>TASImage / libAfterImage</h4>
<ul>

<li> In <tt>TImageDump</tt> the way the markers 6 and 7 are drawn 
     (medium dot and big dot) has been changed to make sure they have
     the same size as the one on screen.
<li> Changes in libAfterImage (draw.c & draw.h), TASImage.cxx
     and TImageDump.cxx in order to produce nice looking 
     circular (hollow and solid) markers. Previously the line 
     used to draw hollow circular markers looked very thick and 
     the solid ones did not look circular.
<li> Remove the global variable named "dpy" in libAfterImage. It produced
     an error if a user program used that simple variable name. "dpy"
     was a pointer to a "Display".
</ul>

<h4>PostScript and PDF</h4>
<ul>
<li> Now, a text with size 0 is not drawn in PDF files. An invalid
     PDF file is created if a text with size 0 is produced.
</ul>
