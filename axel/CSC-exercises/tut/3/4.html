<h1>ROOT Exercise III</h1>
<h3>PROOF (2/3)</h3>
  <p>That worked, and it was faster - but it wasn't impressively fast.
  What about running the same selector on a whole cluster?
  We have set up a PROOF "virtual machine" cluster for you: it uses one core of all the exercise machines.
  Depending on when you get here the PROOF cluster might be pretty busy or completely empty,
  and you will get a performance improvement that depends on the available resources.</p>
  <p>So let's run it! The PROOF master is called <tt>"server"</tt>. Any speed difference?</p>

<div class="help" id="help1">
  <p>The lecture tells you how to initialize a PROOF session. You will need to give the master as an argument.
  Don't forget to tell the <tt>TChain</tt> to use PROOF for <tt>Process()</tt>.
  And yes, that's of course also in the lecture.</p>
  <p>If you have a problem connecting to the PROOF server please try again.
  If the problem persists we might have to restart the server... so let us know!</p>
</div>

<div class="help" id="helps">
  <p>To start PROOF run <tt>TProof::Open("server")</tt>.
  It will tell you the number of nodes that it connected for you.
  Then inform the <tt>TChain</tt> that it should use PROOF,
  e.g. by adding the line <tt>ch->SetProof()</tt> to your chain setup script.
  Now you run the selector like before: <tt>ch->Process(...)</tt> and it will use PROOF!
