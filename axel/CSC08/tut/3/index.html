<h1>ROOT Exercise III</h1>
<p>When you are done with today's exercise, you can help your colleagues...</p>

  <li class="lvl1">Exercise I: The Basics.</li>

  <li class="lvl1"><span class="today">Exercise III: Tree-Based Analysis.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>In this session you will learn how to analyze trees.<p/>
<p>You need to download the code from <a href="../3.tar.bz2">3.tar.bz2</a> and then run</p>
<pre>tar xjf 3.tar.bz2
cd 3</pre>
<p>These are your exercises for this session:</p>
<ol>

  <li class="lvl1">My First TSelector
    <ol>    
      <li><p>Explore the tree in <a href="beamspot.root" class="source">beamspot.root</a>.
      It contains the position of the primary collision of the beam's particles
      ("vertex 0" or "primary vertex") for a virtual experiment.
      The position is stored in centimeters relative to the center of the detector.
      For each position (x|y|z) the tree also denotes the time stamp of the collision,
      where everything (year up to second) is in one branch,
      and the fractions of seconds are stored in another branch.
      What branches does it have? What is its structure?</p>
      <a href="help31.html" class="help1">HELP!</a></li>

      <li><p>Actually you have more than just one file - the tree is spread over several ROOT files.
      So you want to create a TChain from them all.
      How much time of data taking does the tree from all the <tt>beamspot*.root</tt> files correspond to?</p>
      <a href="help41.html" class="help1">HELP!</a></li>

      <li><p>We have written a TSelector for you that analyzes this tree; you can find it in <a href="TBeamSpotSel.h" class="source">TBeamSpotSel.h</a> and <a href="TBeamSpotSel.C" class="source">TBeamSpotSel.C</a>.
      Run it in compiled mode, e.g. using <tt>TTree::Process()</tt> on the tree in <a href="beamspot.root" class="source">beamspot.root</a>.
      What does it display?</p>
      <a href="help51.html" class="help1">HELP!</a></li>

      <li><p>One of the experiment's students is a notorious party animal.
      One day he had to fix a cable close to the detector,
      but because he didn't have enough sleep he stumbled and fell.
      Of course he didn't tell anyone - but can you find out the exact time when it happened?
      Can you tell what has happened, maybe even (roughly) where he was working?
      Only that much: it happened during the period of time that you have data for.</p>
      <a href="help61.html" class="help1">HELP!</a></li>

      <li><p>A beam's particles are not always colliding at the same position, even without external contributions.
      What is the width of the beam for this experiment, in x, y, and z?
      Does it change over time?</p>
      <a href="help71.html" class="help1">HELP!</a></li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li class="lvl1">Running a TSelector with PROOF <em>[OPTIONAL!]</em>.
    <ol>
      <li><p>Before we can use PROOF you need to start a PROOF daemon from the shell:
      <pre>xrootd -c xpd.cf -b</pre>
      You can now start a PROOF job (a <em>session</em> and a <em>query</em>)
      by running <a href="run.C" class="source">run.C</a> from within ROOT.
      Look at <a href="run.C" class="source">run.C</a> to see how similar it is compared to a non-PROOF analysis.</p>
      <a href="help91.html" class="help1">HELP!</a></li>

      <li><p>Can you find out why PROOF spawns the amount of workers it does (it should be two)?</p>
      <a href="helpA1.html" class="help1">HELP!</a></li>

      <li><p>Try to change the number of workers on your computer (e.g set up 6 workers).</p>
      <a href="helpB1.html" class="help1">HELP!</a></li>

  </li>

<h2>
Selector: draw complex var (i.e. lots of trogonometrics, loops, correlations, maybe a minimization!) but only small events (little I/O)
New TTree spread over several TFiles (TChain) accessible via http.

If Quad-Core: 2 cores for proof cluster; test selector on local, proof lite, proof cluster.
