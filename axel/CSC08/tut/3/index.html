<h1>ROOT Exercise III</h1>
<p>When you are done with today's exercise, you can help your colleagues...</p>
<ul>
  <li class="lvl1">Exercise I: The Basics.</li>
  <li class="lvl1">Exercise II: I/O and Trees.</li>
  <li class="lvl1"><span class="today">Exercise III: Tree-Based Analysis.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>In this session you will learn how to analyze trees.<p/>
<p>You need to download the code from <a href="../3.tar.bz2">3.tar.bz2</a> and then run</p>
<pre>tar xjf 3.tar.bz2
cd 3</pre>
<p>These are your exercises for this session:</p>
<ol>

  <li class="lvl1">My First TSelector
    <ol>    
      <li><p>We have created a selector (starting from the output of <tt>TTree::MakeSelector()</tt>) for you;
	  see the files <a href="TPosCorr.h" class="source">TPosCorr.h</a> and <a href="TPosCorr.C" class="source">TPosCorr.C</a>.
	  Run it on the TTree MyTree spread over the files</p>
	  <pre>
	  http://server/exercise3.root
	  http://server/exercise3_1.root
	  http://server/exercise3_2.root
	  http://server/exercise3_3.root
	  http://server/exercise3_4.root
	  http://server/exercise3_5.root
	  http://server/exercise3_6.root
	  </pre>
	  <p>Run the selector in compiled mode on the whole tree.</p>

  </ol></li>

  <li class="lvl1">PROOF
    <ol>    
      <li><p>That worked, but it wasn't impressively fast. What about running the same selector on PROOF?
	  We have set up a PROOF cluster for you - you are sitting in front of it.
	  During the first exercise, you all used one core of your machine.
	  PROOF is configured to use one core of your machine, too - but on all machines!
	  Depending on when you get here the PROOF cluster might be pretty busy or completely empty,
	  and you will get a performance improvement that depends on the available resources.</p>
	  <p>So let's run it! The PROOF master is called <tt>"server"</tt>. Any speed difference?</p>
      <a href="help21.html" class="help1">HELP!</a></li>
	  
      <li><p>That was fast, right? Now let's do it interactively. Quit ROOT and start it again.
	  Simply run <tt>TProof::Open()</tt>. The GUI will allow you to do the same as in the previous exercise.
	  Once the selector has run, look at the histograms that are displayed: there are plenty of PROOF statistics like
	  the number of events per node.	  
	  </p>
      <a href="help31.html" class="help1">HELP!</a></li>

      <li><p>Instead of using the whole PROOF cluster, only use your local machine by running the selector in proof lite.</p>

  <!--
  NO PROXY FOR NOW
  <li class="lvl1">My Second TSelector [OPTIONAL!]
    <ol>
	<li><p>New create your own TSelector - this time we use a different mechanism called Proxy.
	You can create a skeleton proxy-based TSelector from a TTree by calling <tt>TTree::MakeProxy(...)</tt>.
	Modify it so it does what the previous selector did (you may remove the call to Sleep() now ;-).
	This kind of selector is powerful because it determines itself what part of the TTree must be read,
	without the need to specify branches etc.</p>
