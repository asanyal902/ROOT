<h1>ROOT Exercise III - Help Level 1</h1>
<p>Got stuck? This might help:</p>
<h2>2 My First TSelector</h2>

<div class="exercise">
Explore the tree in <a href="beamspot.root" class="source">beamspot.root</a>.
It contains the position of the primary collision of the beam's particles
("vertex 0" or "primary vertex") for a virtual experiment.
The position is stored in centimeters relative to the center of the detector.
For each position (x|y|z) the tree also denotes the time stamp of the collision,
where everything (year up to second) is in one branch,
and the fractions of seconds are stored in another branch.
What branches does it have? What is its structure?
</div>

<p>You start ROOT and create a TBrowser.
You switch to the current directory and double click beamspot.root.
Like that, TBrowser opens it and adds it to the left panel.
Select it, and double-click your way through it:
you can e.g. draw the data of the tree by double-clicking its branches.</p>
<p>You will see that the file contains one tree that is called "tree3".
It has only one branch, which in turn has several sub-branches and one leaf.
Note how TBrowser can even offer functions for fTime, but not for fVtx0.
TBrowser knows the class stored by fTime (<tt>TDatime</tt> is part of ROOT)
but not the custom (i.e. not part of ROOT) class stored in fVtx.</p>
