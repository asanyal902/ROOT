<h1>ROOT Exercise III - Solution</h1>
<p>Got stuck? This is the solution</p>
<h2>2 My First TSelector</h2>

<div class="exercise">
Actually you have more than just one file - the tree is spread over several ROOT files.
So you want to create a TChain from them all.
How much time of data taking does the tree from all the <tt>beamspot*.root</tt> files correspond to?
</div>

<pre>TChain* ch = new TChain("tree3"); // create the chain, giving the trees' name
ch-&gt;Add("beamspot*.root"); // add all files
ch-&gt;Draw("eventinfo.fTime"); // draw the date and time. we find 2008-06-23, 16:05.

// there are one million micro seconds in a second,
// so divide them by 1000000. to get fractions of seconds
ch-&gt;Draw("eventinfo.fTime.GetSecond() + eventinfo.fMuSec / 1000000.");
</pre>
<p>But that does not give you enough detail: when was the first event taken?
When the last one?</p>

<p>The simplest solution is to scan through the tree,
see the documentation of TTree::Scan():
<pre>ch-&gt;Scan("eventinfo.fTime.GetSecond() + eventinfo.fMuSec / 1000000",
                 "", "", 1);
</pre>

<p>And the last event:
<pre>ch-&gt;Scan("eventinfo.fTime.GetSecond() + eventinfo.fMuSec / 1000000.",
                 "", "", 1, ch-&gt;GetEntries()-1);
</pre>
<p>The chain tells you that the first event was taken at 2008-06-23, 16:05:00.76431;
the last one was taken at 2008-06-23, 16:05:51.47468.</p>
