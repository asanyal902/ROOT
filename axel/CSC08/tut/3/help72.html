<h1>ROOT Exercise III - Help Level 2</h1>
<p>Got stuck? This might help even more:</p>
<h2>2 My First TSelector</h2>

<div class="exercise">
A beam's particles are not always colliding at the same position, even without external contributions.
What is the width of the beam for this experiment, in x, y, and z?
Does it change over time?
</div>

<p>To plot the distribution of e.g. x you should create a one dimensional histogram that you fill with just the x coordinate.
You can then draw it; the "RMS" value shown is the width.</p>
<p>To decide whether a coordinate should be filled into the before-move histogram or the after-move histogram you can simply compare the current event's time stamp with the time of the move.</p>
