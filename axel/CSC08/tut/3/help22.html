<h1>ROOT Exercise III - Help Level 2</h1>
<p>Got stuck? This might help:</p>
<h2>1 My First TSelector</h2>

<div class="exercise">
<p>Modify and run the selector to create a histogram of the radius r = sqrt(x^2 * y^2).</p>
</div>

<p>
Before we were filling a two-dimensional TH2F. The radius is one single value, so we need a one-dimensional histogram TH1F instead.
You will need to change both the declaration of the histogram (see the header file <a href="TPosCorr.h" class="source">TPosCorr.h</a>)
and the creation of the object (<tt>new TH2F(...)</tt>). You only need to pass the value of the radius to <tt>TH1F::Fill(...)</tt>.</p>
