<h1>ROOT Exercise III - Help Level 1</h1>
<p>Got stuck? This might help:</p>
<h2>2 My First TSelector</h2>

<div class="exercise">
Actually you have more than just one file - the tree is spread over several ROOT files.
So you want to create a TChain from them all.
How much time of data taking does the tree from all the <tt>beamspot*.root</tt> files correspond to?
</div>

<p>You should use a TChain to open a tree spread over multiple files.
It's part of the lecture.</p>
<p>Once you have the chain you can draw a part (a "leaf") of it using e.g.
<tt>TChain::Draw()</tt>.
Which part to draw should be obvious because you know fromthe previous exercise what's in the tree.</p>
