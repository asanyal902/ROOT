<h1>ROOT Exercise III - Help Level 1</h1>
<p>Got stuck? This might help:</p>
<h2>2 My First TSelector</h2>

<div class="exercise">
<p>New create your own TSelector - this time we use a different mechanism called Proxy.
	You can create a skeleton proxy-based TSelector from a TTree by calling <tt>TTree::MakeProxy(...)</tt>.
	Modify it so it does what the previous selector did (you may remove the call to Sleep() now ;-).
	This kind of selector is powerful because it determines itself what part of the TTree must be read,
	without the need to specify branches etc.</p>
</div>

<p>You should use a TChain to open a tree spread over multiple files.
It's part of the lecture.</p>
<p>Once you have the chain you can draw a part (a "leaf") of it using e.g.
<tt>TChain::Draw()</tt>.
Which part to draw should be obvious because you know from the previous exercise what's in the tree.</p>
