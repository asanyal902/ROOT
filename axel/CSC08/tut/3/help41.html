<h1>ROOT Exercise III - Help Level 1</h1>
<p>Got stuck? This might help:</p>
<h2>2 PROOF</h2>

<div class="exercise">
<p>That worked, but it wasn't impressively fast. What about running the same selector on PROOF?
	  We have set up a PROOF cluster for you - you are sitting in front of it.
	  During the first exercise, you all used one core of your machine.
	  PROOF is configured to use one core of your machine, too - but on all machines!
	  Depending on when you get here the PROOF cluster might be pretty busy or completely empty,
	  and you will get a performance improvement that depends on the available resources.</p>
	  <p>So let's run it! The PROOF master is called <tt>"server"</tt>. Any speed difference?</p>
</div>

<p>The lecture tells you how to initialize a PROOF session. You will need to give the master as an argument.
Don't forget to tell the <tt>TChain</tt> to use PROOF for <tt>Process()</tt>.
And yes, that's of course also in the lecture.</p>
<p>If you have a problem connecting to the PROOF server please try again.
If the problem persists we might have to restart the server... so let us know!</p>
