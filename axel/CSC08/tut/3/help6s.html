<h1>ROOT Exercise III - Solution</h1>
<p>Got stuck? This is the solution</p>
<h2>2 My First TSelector</h2>

<div class="exercise">
One of the experiment's students is a notorious party animal.
One day he had to fix a cable close to the detector,
but because he didn't have enough sleep he stumbled and fell.
Of course he didn't tell anyone - but can you find out the exact time when it happened?
Can you tell what has happened, maybe even (roughly) where he was working?
Only that much: it happened during the period of time that you have data for.
</div>

<p>Change TBeamSpotSel.C to draw hBeamSpotZ_Time instead of hBeamSpotXYZ:
<pre>
void TBeamSpotSel::Terminate()
{
   TH1* h = (TH1*) GetOutputList()->FindObject("hBeamSpotZ_Time");
   h->Draw();
}
</pre>
<p>You will see that in the bin for 35-36 seconds something has happened:
the Z position of the beam spot is shifted by about 1.5cm.
This could mean that the beam has moved, or that the reference frame (the detector) has moved.
Knowing that the student stumbled, he probably fell against the detector and moved it.</p>

<p>The beam position has moved towards higher Z, so the detector has moved towards negative Z.
The falling student, bumping into the detector, must thus have been standing at the positive Z side of the detector, pretty much like this (where the gray arrows are obviously the beam particles):</p>
