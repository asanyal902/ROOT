<h2>1 Scopes</h2>

<div class="exercise">
Run the macro <a href="histogram.C" class="source">histogram.C</a>.
It is supposed to display a histogram, but something is wrong.
Fix the macro so the histogram gets displayed.
</div>

<p>You run the code by starting ROOT (run <tt>root</tt> at the shell)
and the executing <tt>.x histogram.C</tt></p>
<p>To fix the macro you will need to look at the code,
e.g. by running <tt>emacs histogram.C</tt>.
The histogram gets created by this line:
<pre>TH1F h1("h1", "Random numbers", 200, 0.0, 10.0);</pre>
and drawn by this line:
<pre>h1.Draw();</pre>
<p>Then the function returns, and ROOT's prompt gains control again.
That's when you want to see the histogram which for some reason doesn't get displayed - all you can see is an empty window (the canvas).
So something must have happened between the drawing of the histogram and you looking at the canvas.</p>

<p>Hint: check the lecture's part on scopes.</p>
