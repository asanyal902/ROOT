<h2>2 Constructors and alike</h2>

<div class="exercise">
<p>Execute the macro <a href="test_motorcycle.C" class="source">test_motorcycle.C</a>.
      This macro creates and loads a library containing the class <tt>TMotorcycle</tt>, which
      is defined in <a href="Motorcycle.h" class="source">Motorcycle.h</a> and
      <a href="Motorcycle.C" class="source">Motorcycle.C</a>.
      <a href="test_motorcycle.C" class="source">test_motorcycle.C</a> is very inefficient - and
      your assignment is to figure out why. To do that, count how many times the constructor,
      copy constructor, assignment operator and destructor are called. You should modify
      <a href="Motorcycle.C" class="source">Motorcycle.C</a>
      for that.</p>
      <p>The copy constructor and assignment operator can be extremely expensive,
      e.g. for large vectors of large objects,
      so it is important to learn how to write code that avoids their invocation.</p>
</div>

<p>The file <a href="Motorcycle.C" class="source">Motorcycle.C</a> contains all the functions that the question mentions;
see the comments.
You could visualize the calls to these functions by adding a print statement.</p>
