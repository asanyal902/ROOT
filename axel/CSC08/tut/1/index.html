<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>In this session you will learn about scopes, what constructors and assignment operators do, and how to draw histograms and change their style.<p/>
<p>You need to download the code from <a href="../1.tar.bz2">1.tar.bz2</a> and then run</p>
<pre>tar xjf 1.tar.bz2
cd 1</pre>
<p>These are your exercises for this session:</p>
<ol>
  <li class="lvl1">Scopes
    <ol>
      <li><p>Run the macro <a href="histogram.C" class="source">histogram.C</a>.
      It is supposed to display a histogram, but something is wrong.
      Fix the macro so the histogram gets displayed.</p>
      <a href="help11.html" class="help1">HELP!</a></li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li class="lvl1">Constructors and alike
    <ol>    
      <li><p>Execute the macro <a href="test_motorcycle.C" class="source">test_motorcycle.C</a>.
      This macro loads a library containing the class <tt>TMotorcycle</tt>, and using this class
      it tries to display several motorcycle branchs and models.
      As you can see the macro has a bug - it only displays one kind of motorcycles. Fix that!
      You might want to run it in compiled mode with ACLiC (adding a "+" behind the file name).</p>
      <a href="help21.html" class="help1">HELP!</a></li>

      <li><p>TMotorcycle prints whenever its constructor or assignment operator etc are called.
      Why did that (mostly) stop when you fixed the macro?</p>
      <p>In reality, these functions can be extremely expensive,
      e.g. for large vectors of large objects,
      so it is important to learn how to write code that avoids their invocation.</p>

  </li>
  <li class="lvl1">Drawing and Editing Histograms
    <ol>
      <li><p>Execute <a href="ages.C" class="source">ages.C</a>.
      It creates and displays a histogram showing teh age distribution of the participants of the CSC08.
      Use the editor (in the TCanvas's menu under View &gt; Editor) to make the histogram look like this one:</p>
      <p><img src="ages.png" class="default" alt="goal histogram from ages.C"></p>
      <a href="help41.html" class="help1">HELP!</a></li>
      <li><p>Save the histogram to <tt>styledhist.C</tt>
      (e.g. see the Canvas's file menue, or right-click the histogram)
      and look at that saved file.
      Restart ROOT and run <tt>styleshist.C</tt> to check that ROOT really
      does store the histogram as C++ code.</p>
      <a href="help51.html" class="help1">HELP!</a></li>
      <li><p>The style settings you set with the editor are preserved in the .C file.
      Identify and use the function calls in <tt>styleshist.C</tt> to change ages.C
      such that it displays the histogram styled like the example picture above.</p>
