<h1>ROOT Exercise I - Help Level 1</h1>
<p>Got stuck? This might help:</p>
<h2>2 Constructors and alike</h2>

<div class="exercise">
Execute the macro <a href="test_motorcycle.C" class="source">test_motorcycle.C</a>.
      This macro loads a library containing the class <tt>TMotorcycle</tt>, and using this class
      it tries to display several motorcycle branchs and models.
      As you can see the macro has a bug - it only displays one kind of motorcycles. Fix that!
</div>

<p>You run the code by starting ROOT (run <tt>root</tt> at the shell)
and the executing <tt>.x test_motorcycle.C</tt></p>
<p>To fix the macro you will need to look at the code,
e.g. by running <tt>emacs test_motorcycle.C</tt>.
The motorcycle gets created by this line:
<pre>TMotorcycle mybike("Honda", "VTX1300S", 1312, 55);</pre>
and the class informations are dump by this function:
<pre>printinfos(mybike);</pre>
<p>Then the class informations (e.g. brand, model and so on) are modified several times.
The macro should display something like this on the command line:
<pre>
<tt>Brand: Honda - Model: VTX1300S - Cubic Capacity: 1312 - Power: 55</tt>
<tt>Brand: Suzuki - Model: M800Z - Cubic Capacity: 805 - Power: 39</tt>
<tt>Brand: Yamaha - Model: XVS1300A - Cubic Capacity: 1304 - Power: 53.5</tt>
<tt>Brand: Kawasaki - Model: VN900C - Cubic Capacity: 903 - Power: 37</tt>
<tt>Brand: Harley-Davidson - Model: FXCWC - Cubic Capacity: 1584 - Power: 49.236</tt>
</pre>
<pre>
And the canvas should display pictures of all brands, as shown in this picture:
<img alt="Canvas displaying motorcycles" src="c1.png">
</pre>
</p>

<p>Hint: check the lecture's part on constructors.</p>
