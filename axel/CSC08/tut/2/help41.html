<h1>ROOT Exercise II - Help Level 1</h1>
<p>Got stuck? This might help:</p>
<h2>1 Reading a TTree</h2>

<div class="exercise">
Looking at the macro you probably saw that it reads the ROOT file over the network.
Usually there is no difference to reading it from a local disk.
You can speed it up (even if you were reading from disk) by enabling only the branches that you really need to read.
Well, give it a try!
</div>

<p>See the lecture on selecting which branches to access.
Then see which branches you access, and tell that to the tree!
The trick is to first disable everything, and then to enable only what you need.
Simple, he?</p>
