Help your colleagues instead!</p>

</ul>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>In this session you will learn how to read and write objects, including TTrees.<p/>
<p>You need to download the code from <a href="../2.tar.bz2">2.tar.bz2</a> and then run</p>
<pre>tar xjf 2.tar.bz2
cd 2</pre>
<p>These are your exercises for this session:</p>
<ol>
  <li class="lvl1">I/O
    <ol>
      <li><p>Run the macro <a href="ages_io.C" class="source">ages_io.C</a>
      For some reason, the histogram does not stay on the canvas.
      Please repair that!</p>
      <a href="help11.html" class="help1">HELP!</a></li>

      <li><p>The script creates a ROOT file.
      Quit ROOT and restart it, then use the TBrowser to look at the ROOT file.
      Draw the histogram that's stored in it.</p>
      <a href="help21.html" class="help1">HELP!</a></li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li class="lvl1">Reading a TTree
      <p>Note that for these exercises, timing is a <em>key ingredient</em>, so please remember the printed times.</p>
    <ol>
      <li><p>Execute <a href="read_tree.C" class="source">read_tree.C<b>+</b></a> (note the plus!).
      Modify the macro to read the muons; use the TBrowser to determine the name of the branch.</p>
      <a href="help31.html" class="help1">HELP!</a></li>

      <li><p>Looking at the macro you probably saw that it reads the ROOT file over the network.
      Usually there is no difference to reading it from a local disk.
      You can speed it up (even if you were reading from disk) by enabling only the branches that you really need to read.
      Well, give it a try!</p>
      <a href="help41.html" class="help1">HELP!</a></li>

      <li><p>Instead of plotting the Pt distribution, generate a histogram of another value.</p>
      <a href="help51.html" class="help1">HELP!</a></li>

      <li><p>Use <tt>TTree::Draw()</tt> to draw the same expression.
      Is the performance comparable to the read performance with all branches enabled?</p>
      <a href="help61.html" class="help1">HELP!</a></li>

      <li><p>Now you use <tt>TTree::Draw()</tt> again, but on a non-split tree (split-level 0). The tree can be found in the file
      <tt>TFile::Open("http://localhost/ROOT/exercise2_nonsplit.root")</tt>. Draw the same expression as before. Do you notice a timing
      difference? Is that expected?</p>
