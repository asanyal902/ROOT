<h1>ROOT Exercise II - Help Level 1</h1>
<p>Got stuck? This might help:</p>
<h2>1 I/O</h2>

<div class="exercise">
The script creates a ROOT file.
Quit ROOT and restart it, then use the TBrowser to look at the ROOT file.
Draw the histogram that's stored in it.
</div>

<p>You start the browser by <tt>new TBrowser()</tt>.
Simply open the file in the current directory and then select it in the left panel.
You can now see what's inside; double clicking on elements will call their <tt>Browse()</tt> method; for histograms it simply draws them.</p>
