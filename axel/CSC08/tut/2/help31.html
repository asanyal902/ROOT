<h1>ROOT Exercise II - Help Level 1</h1>
<p>Got stuck? This might help:</p>
<h2>1 Reading a TTree</h2>

<div class="exercise">
Execute <a href="read_tree.C" class="source">read_tree.C<b>+</b></a> (note the plus!).
Modify the macro to read the muons; use the TBrowser to determine the name of the branch.
</div>

<p>You start the browser by <tt>new TBrowser()</tt>.
It shows several branches; the branch that the macro currently reads out ("electrons") is one of them.
All top level branches contain a collection (<tt>TClonesArray</tt>) that themselves contain classes deriving from <tt>MyParticle</tt>.
You can see details in <a href="myparticle.h" class="source">myparticle.h</a>.
When changing read_tree.C to read a different branch, think of the data flow from setting the branch's address to the local variable to reading to filling the histogram: what is different for the muons and the electrons?</p>
