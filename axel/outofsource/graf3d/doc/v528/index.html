<h3>3D Graphics Primitives</h3>
<h4>TPolyMarker3D</h4>
<ul>
<li>TPolyMarker3D::PaintH3 entered an infinite loop in case of huge
bin content </li>
</ul>

<h3>OpenGL</h3>

<h4>Major changes</h4>

<ul>

<li>GL in Pad: It is now possible to save a PadGL into a binary image file
  (gif, png, jpg etc...).</li>

<li>Improve behaviour of TGLEventHandler and make it consistent:
<ol>
  <li>Process only one mouse button (the first pressed) at any
  time. </li>
  <li>All selections take effect on button release.</li>
  <li>Precsion modifiers Shift and Control can thus be pressed at any
  time for controlling rate of rotation, translation or zooming.</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li>Add support for multiple secondary-selection and partial
  highlightning of secondary-selectable sub-items. This requires new
  signals to be emitted from TGLViewer:
<pre>
   virtual void MouseOver  (TObject *obj, UInt_t state); // *SIGNAL*
   virtual void ReMouseOver(TObject *obj, UInt_t state); // *SIGNAL*
   virtual void UnMouseOver(TObject *obj, UInt_t state); // *SIGNAL*
</pre>
  TGLEventHandler emits them when needed. For example see TEveDigitSet
  and its sub-classes TEveQuadSet and TEveBoxSet.
</li>

<li>It is now possible to enforce all tesselations of geometry shapes
  to only use triangles via static function <tt>void
  TGLFaceSet::EnforceTriangles()</tt>. This is needed to export TGeo
  shapes and CSG meshes to external triangle-mesh libraries that can
  not handle arbitrary polygons.</li>

</ul>

<h4>Minor changes</h4>

<ul>

<li>Extend configurability of GL event-handler to allow inversion of
controls from scene-centric to viewer-centric. The following rootrc
variables control the behaviour:
<pre>
   OpenGL.EventHandler.ViewerCentricControls:  1
   OpenGL.EventHandler.ArrowKeyFactor:        -1.0
   OpenGL.EventHandler.MouseDragFactor:       -1.0
   OpenGL.EventHandler.MouseWheelFactor:      -1.0
</pre>
</li>

<li>Added new overlay element class TGLCameraGuide that shows the
orientation of major axes. To use, call this on a TGLViewer object:
<pre>
   gl_viewer->AddOverlayElement(new TGLCameraGuide(0.9, 0.1, 0.08));
</pre>
</li>

<li>Fix an issue with GL-clip object not being properly updated after
a scene update.</li>

<li>Hide / show menu-bar with a time-out (default 400ms). This can be
adjusted by calling static method:<pre>
  TGLSAViewer::SetMenuHidingTimeout(200);</pre>
</li>

</ul>


<h3>EVE</h3>

<h4>Major changes</h4>

<ul>

<li>Implement central infractructure to allow eve-elements to support
internal multiple selection and highlightning of their sub-parts.
<br/>
Use this in TEveDigitSet and its sub-classes TEveQuadSet and
TEveBoxSet.
<ul>
<li>TEveSecondarySelectable - New secondary base-class for elements
  supporting internal multiple selection / highlight.</li>

<li>TEveViewer - Add functions to handle additional mouse-over signals
  from TGLViewer.</li>

<li>TEveElement - Add 3 new functions:<pre>
    virtual TString  GetHighlightTooltip();
    virtual void     UnSelected();
    virtual void     UnHighlighted();
</pre></li>

<li> TEveDigitSet, TEveQuadSet, TEveBoxSet
<ul>
  <li>Sub-class TEveDigitSet from TEveSecondarySelectable.</li>
  <li>Implement functions needed for internal selection.</li>
  <li>Add common base-class TEveDigitSetGL for quad and box-set GL rendering.</li>
  <li>Move anti-flickering controls from TEveQuadSet to TEveDigitSet and
    implement it also in TEveBoxSetGL.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>TEveChunkManager - Add support for restricted iteration.
  TEveChunkManager::iterator accepts set&lt;Int_t&gt; for that purpose.</li>
</ul></li>


<li>TEveElement -- Extensions for configurable selection / highlight /
  color / transparency propagation between compounds and elements. The
  following options can be activated:
<ul>
  <li>ImplySelectAllChildren() - to highlight / imply-select all
    children of an compound;</li>

  <li>TakeAnyParentAsMaster() - to upwards propagate mouse-selection to
    any compound parent;</li>

  <li>ApplyMainColorToAllChildren() / ApplyMainColorToMatchingChildren()
    to request color propagation to all / matching children of a compound;</li>

  <li>ApplyMainTransparencyToAllChildren() / ApplyMainTransparencyToMatchingChildren()
    to request transparency propagation to all / matching children of a compound.</li>
</ul>
These flags are stored as bit pattern of CompoundColorSelectionBits enum.
</li>

<li>TEveElement: propagate transparency to projected replicas. As this
  is implemented in the base-class, it works for all projectable classes.</li>

<li>
TEveVector, TEveVector4 and TEveVector2 are now typedefs to float
specialization of corresponding templates. Double versions use 'D' as
postfix, 'F' postfix is another alias for float versions, e.g.:<pre>
    typedef TEveVectorT&lt;Float_t&gt;  TEveVector;
    typedef TEveVectorT&lt;Float_t&gt;  TEveVectorF;
    typedef TEveVectorT&lt;Double_t&gt; TEveVectorD;
</pre></li>

<li>All projectable classes now take into account their transformation
  matrix. The projected versions are still stored in global
  coordinates.</li>

<li>TEveShape -- a new abstract base-class for 2D/3D shapes that
  require fill color and outline color / line-width.</li>

<li>New class TEveBox to draw simple cuboid with minimal memory
  usage. It is projectable.</li>

<li>TEveJetCone is now projectable.</li>

<li>Several performance improvements when dealing with large
  collections of EVE objects. Profiled with simulated heavy-ion data.</li>

</ul>

<h4>Minor changes</h4>

<ul>

<li>Add support for projecting a new child (all childredn) of an
element after the element and its old children have already been
projected. This is provided by the following virtual functions in
TEveElement: by:<pre>
  void ProjectChild(TEveElement* el, Bool_t sameDepth=kTRUE);
  void ProjectAllChildren(Bool_t same_depth=kTRUE);
</pre></li>

<li>Several improvements in drawing of TEveCalo axes and labels.</li>

<li>TEveTrackPropagator. Fix some issues with Runge-Kutta track
  propagator. Move in controls specifying how to plot tracks that get
  split in RhoZ projection.</li>

<li>Fix rendering of TEveJetCone: normals at apex were not changing as they should.</li>

<li>Support single-color for TEveDigitSet (call TEveDigitSet::UseSingleColor()).</li>

<li>Always add children of an element to the GUI list-tree. There was
  a problem when elements having children were added to the list-tree,
  the children were not added.</li>

<li>TEveLine has its own icon now. The icon for TEvePointSet was used
  before and this caused confusion.</li>

</ul>
