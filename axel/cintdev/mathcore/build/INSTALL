To install MathCore from CVS do the following: 

   >   cvs -d :pserver:cvs@root.cern.ch:/user/cvs co -d mathcore root/mathcore


   >   cd mathcore 

 run the setup script which uses autoconf and automake to generate the makefile. Be sure to have a not too old version of autoconf/automake installed in your system 


   >   build/setup.sh


configure with the configure script. See ./configure --help for more options. 

   > ./configure 


   > make

   

To build the test do: 

   > make check 

and to run them (like coordinates3D) do: 

   > test/coordinates3D

If you install from the tar file, you can skip the setup part and run directly configure.
