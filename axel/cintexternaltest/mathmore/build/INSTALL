To install MathMore from CVS do the following: 

   >   cvs -d :pserver:cvs@root.cern.ch:/user/cvs co -d mathmore root/mathmore


   >   cd mathmore 

 run the setup script which uses autoconf and automake to generate the makefile. Be sure to have a not too old version of autoconf/automake installed in your system 


   >   build/setup.sh


configure with the configure script. To use MathMore outside ROOT, you need to specify a location of GSL. A tar file of GSL with the functions needed by MathMore is available in the mathmore/src directory. If you don't have a version of GSL in your system you can build  the one distributed with mathmore using configure and make. 


   > ./configure --with-gsl=$gsl_dir



   > make

   

To build the test do: 

   > make check 

and to run them (like testRootFinder)  do: 

   > test/testRootFinder

If you install from the tar file, you can skip the setup part and run directly configure.
