	* core/base/inc/TVirtualGL.h Removed TVirtualGLManip - now
	obsolete and not used anywhere at all (also removed
	TVirtualGLManager corresponding member).

	* core/base/inc/LinkDef1.h removed pragma for TVirtualGLManip

	* core/base/src/TVirtualGL.cxx removed ClassImp for TVirtualGLManip

	* win32gdk removed SelectManip methods from GL proxy and win32glmanager

	* TGLAdapter class can be completely removed

	* LinkDef.h pragma for TGLAdapter removed

	* TGLManip - does not need to inherit TVirtualGLManip and does not
	need to override Select function.

	Intermediate commit towards usage of FBOs.

	* TEvePadFrame:
	Add members controlling usage/width of FBO and rendering
	time-stamp.
	Connect to all possible pad signals and do a redraw, requesting
	update of display-list or FBO.

	* TEvePadFrameGL:
	Add mutable variables for holding FBO and a time-stamp.
	Add some more rendering functions and implement ShouldDLCache()..
	Also have a static TGLPadPainter -- for FBO.

	* TGLPadPainter:
	Revert all changes.

	* TGLPadPainter3D:
	New sub-class of TVirtualPadPainter -- a near copy of
	TGLPadPainter for now -- but this will soon change.
	It has the changes that were in TGLPadPainter before.

	* TEvePadFrame:
	Add 'Double_t fSizeX' specifying scene-coordinate width of the
	pad.
	Calculate bounding-box accordingly.

	* TEvePadFrameGL:
	Use TGLPadPainter3D instead of TGLPadPainter.
	Proper sclaing / translation of the pad.
	Add back rectangle.

	Prototype implementation of 2D pad drawing in TGLViewer.

	* TCanvas:
	Add function:
	  TVirtualPadPainter *SwitchCanvasPainter(TVirtualPadPainter* new_painter);
	It returns the old painter and allows temporary switch of active
	pad-painter for given canvas.

	* TGLPadPainter:
	Add function:
	  void InitPainterForGLViewer();
	that does minimal initialization.

	* TEvePadFrame, TEvePadFrameGL:
	Prototype for drawing 2D pad in TGLViewer.

	* tutorials/eve/testgl1.C:
	Test for plotting a pad with canvas in TGLViewer.

2010-07-12  Matevz Tadel  <mtadel@pcalice14.cern.ch>

	* TVirtualViewer3D:
	From TVirtualViewer3D remove virtual functions:
	  TObject *SelectObject(Int_t, Int_t){return 0;}
	  void   DrawViewer(){}
	They were never defined and never called.

	* TGLManager, TX11GL, TGWin32GL, TPad:
	Remove TGLManager::PrintViewer().
	Call TVirtualViewer3D::PrintObjects() directly from TPad::Paint()
	when printing -- it was not used elsewhere.
