	* TCanvas:
	Add function:
	  TVirtualPadPainter *SwitchCanvasPainter(TVirtualPadPainter* new_painter);
	It returns the old painter and allows temporary switch of active
	pad-painter for given canvas.

	* TGLPadPainter:
	Add function:
	  void InitPainterForGLViewer();
	that does minimal initialization.

	* TEvePadFrame, TEvePadFrameGL:
	Prototype for drawing 2D pad in TGLViewer.

	* tutorials/eve/testgl1.C:
	Test for plotting a pad with canvas in TGLViewer.

	* TVirtualViewer3D:
	From TVirtualViewer3D remove virtual functions:
	  TObject *SelectObject(Int_t, Int_t){return 0;}
	  void   DrawViewer(){}
	They were never defined and never called.

	* TGLManager, TX11GL, TGWin32GL, TPad:
	Remove TGLManager::PrintViewer().
	Call TVirtualViewer3D::PrintObjects() directly from TPad::Paint()
	when printing -- it was not used elsewhere.
