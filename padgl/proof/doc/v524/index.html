<h3>Proof</h3>
<ul>
<li>New functionality</li>
<ul>
<li> Add support for session queuing in the scheduler. This
allows to control the number of sessions allowed to process queries
concurrently. The feature is enabled by a new parameter 'queue:fifo' in
the 'xpd.schedparam' directive. In case of static worker assignment
(default, random,
round-robin) the max number of running sessions can be limited by
another new parameter 'mxrun'; for
example<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; <big><span style="font-family: monospace;">xpd.schedparam default
mxrun:3 queue:fifo</span></big><br>
will run concurrently only 3 sessions. Additional requests are queued and run as soon as one of the running
sessions goes idle. The current policy is FIFO, so that there is a rotation among queued
sessions. In the case of load-based worker assignment, the max number of running
queries is determined dynamically.</li>
<li>Add support for repeat functionality in the xrd.worker
directive. To avoid repeating the same line N times one can just add 'repeat=N' in the line; for
example<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; <big><span style="font-family: monospace;">xpd.worker worker proofwrks:2093 repeat=4</span></big><br>
will define 4 workers on port 2093 of machine 'proofwrks'.</li>
