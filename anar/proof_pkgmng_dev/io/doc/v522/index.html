<h3>I/O</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fix the order of creation of the TStreamerInfo during the opening of a ROOT file to insure that the CollectionProxy are properly setup.</li> 


<li>Fix problem: "recover warning when opening an empty file
created with TXNetFile" which was due to a bad check in TFile::Recover
(line TFile.cxx:1561) where the inheritance from TFile should be checked
instead of requiring the name to be "TFile".</li>
