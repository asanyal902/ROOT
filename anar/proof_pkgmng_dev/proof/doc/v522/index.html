<h3>PROOF</h3>


<ul>


  <li>New functionality</li>


  
  <ul>


  
  </ul>


  <li>Improvements:</li>


  
  <ul>


    <li>
Log retrieval:</li>


    
    <ul>


      <li>
for 'grep' operations, use the system 'grep' command via 'popen'
instead of a handmade filtering; this implies that the full grep functionality is now available</li>


      <li>
set the default number of displayed lines to 100 instead of 10</li>


    
    </ul>
    <li>Improve diagnostic in case of worker death: clients will now
receive a message containing the low level reason for the failure and a
hint for getting more information</li>
  </ul>


  
  <ul>


  
  </ul>


  <li>Fixes</li>


  
  <ul>


    <li>
Invalidate the TProofMgr when the physical connection is closed; avoids
crashing when trying to get the logs after a failure.
    </li>


    <li>
Fix a memory leak in log retrieval (the TProofLog object was never
deleted)</li>


    <li>
Add protections for the cases the manager cannot be initialized</li>
    <li>Fix a race condition possibly affecting the handling of workers death</li>
    <li>Avoid duplicating worker logs in the master log file unless
when explicitely needed by the request (Exec(...), Print(...)) or when
an error occured</li>
