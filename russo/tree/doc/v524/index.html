<h3>Tree</h3>
<ul>
<li>Significantly improve performance of TTree Proxy.</li>
<li>Improve read performance of sub-branch containing vector of sinple types.</li>
<li>Fix TTree::LoadBasket to properly handle the (new) case where no basket is stored with the TTree object.</li>
<li>Fix the axis used for an histogram created by TTree::Draw for a branch of TString or std::string objects.</li> 
<li>MakeProxy now correctly support branches that created with a leaflist with more than one leaf
(usually used for C-struct).</li>
<li>TTree::CloneTree and TChain::Merge in fast mode now can recover from some mismatch errors between
the input and output TTrees by falling back to using the 'slow' mode.  In particular this allow
a 'fast cloning' to handle files that requires schema evolution (albeit it is of course much slower).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Parallel Coordinates</h3>
<ul>
<li> Fix a memory leak. The <tt>TParallelCoord</tt> destructor was not called
     when the canvas used to draw it was closed.
</ul>
