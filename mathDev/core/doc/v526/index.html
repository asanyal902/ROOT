<ul>
<li>The following architectures have been obsoleted: linuxkcc, alphakcc,
linuxia64sgi, linuxdeb2ppc, solariskcc, sgikcc and linuxpgcc.</li>
<li>
TBits equality operator nows return true if the 2 operands have different
length and all the bits in the longer TBits that are passed the length
of the shorter TBits are zero (i.e. the default value of each
bits is zero).</li>
</ul>
The new module <tt>editline</tt> enhances the prompt, giving type and syntax feedback using e.g. colors.
Keywords and class names are highlighted blue when typed, indicating that the keyword is known to ROOT.  
Matching parenthesis pairs are highlighted green when typed, or when the cursor is moved to a bracket. This works for () {} and [] brackets.
Any mismatched brackets (those without a matching partner) will be highlighted red when typed or when the cursor is moved to the bracket.
Tab completion output is coloured magenta to differentiate between tab completion output and user input.
All of the colours are configurable in the <tt>.rootrc</tt> file.
The colours available are black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan and white. 
Each can also be specified with options of <tt>bold</tt> (alias <tt>light</tt>) or <tt>underlined</tt>.
An example configuration would be:
<pre>
Rint.TypeColor:			blue
Rint.BracketColor:		bold green
Rint.BadBracketColor:		underlined red
Rint.TabColor:			magenta
Rint.PromptColor:		black
</pre>
These changes are available on all platforms with [n]curses, including Linux, Solaris and MacOS; the bold and underline options are available also for black and white terminals.
Currently, this module is disabled on Windows.
