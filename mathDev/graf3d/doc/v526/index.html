<h3>Eve</h3>

<h4>Major changes</h4>

<ul>

<li> Add support for hierarchical positioning of TEveElements in any
specific scene. This allows for easier positioning of elements in
dynamic scenes when child elements are attached to their parent
elements and are supposed to follow their movements / rotations.

<li> Several significant improvements in TEveCaloLego classes.
<ul>
<li> In top view draw cell values, if their screen size is above given limit.
<li> New energy-scales drawn as overlay (in color and size mode). The
legend can be moved around the screen with the mouse.
<li> Fix transition between orthographic and perspective camera in
TEveCaloLego event handler.
<li> Use color-sets in overlays and axis in order to automatically
keep same contrast when changing background color.
</ul>

<li> In TEveTrackPropagator improve overall trajectory extrapolation
through the path-marks. Fix a problem with path-mark / boundary
approach with near-zero magnetic field.

</ul>

<h4>Minor changes</h4>

<ul>

<li> In TEveFrambox add support for drawing of back-polygons for 3D
frame-boxes. Those should be transparent, otherwise the things inside
are not visible.

<li> TEveRGBAPalette - implement additional flag fFixColorRange specifying
how the palette color range gets mapped onto signal values:<ol>
<li>true  - LowLimit -> HighLimit
<li>false - MinValue -> MaxValue.</ol>

</ul>

<h3>OpenGL</h3>

<h4>Major changes</h4>

<ul>

<li> Support for rendering into frame-buffer objects (FBO).

<li> Using FBOs, it is now possible to save bitmap image formats at
  any resolution and even when the GL window is not on screen.

<li> Add support for global scaling of point-sizes, line-widths and font-sizes.

<li> Editor for "gl5d" option was improved.

<li> TGLTH3Composition class to combine several TH3s in one plot.

</ul>

<h4>Minor changes</h4>

<ul>

<li> Use Diagonal() instead of Volume() to determine if a bounding-box
is empty and also for sorting of the scene-elements by size. The
previous implementation caused problems with 2D and 1D objects.

<li> Several improvements in camera configuration and handling.

<li> When initializing TGLClipPlane for the first time, place it in
the center of the scene's bounding-box. Before that, plane was always
positioned at (0,0,0) which lead to unexpected behaviour when scene
was not centered at the origin.

</ul>
