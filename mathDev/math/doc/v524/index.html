<h4>MathCore</h4>
 Various fixes have been applied. mainly  in the fitting classes, in detail:
<ul>
  <li>Fix issue <a href="http://savannah.cern.ch/bugs/?46006">#46006</a> for normalization of error resulting from fitting a TGraph</li>
  <li>Fix a problem in Chi2 calculation in case of overflow</li>
  <li>Fix issue <href="http://savannah.cern.ch/bugs/?46601">#46601</a> for avoiding crashes when a linear fit fails.</li>
   <li>Fix in the FitData classes the bug <href="http://savannah.cern.ch/bugs/?45909">#45909</a> occurring when setting a function range outside histogram range</li>
   <li>Fix default integration method to be Gauss alalgorithm of MathCore instead of the GSL method, when libMathmore is not built or when the plug-in manager fails to load it. 
  </ul>

<h4>Minuit2</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Apply some fixes in MnHesse and MnPosDef classes to check correctly variables to not be zero.
    (use same checks as in F77Minuit)
    </li>
    <li>Fix a bug introduced in DavidonErrorCalculator when checking for delgam. Negative values are allowed. This fixes a test problem given privatly by A. Suter.
    </li>
    <li>Uses also a tighter condition on edm when exiting the iterations (factor of 5 smaller). This is more consistent with conditions used by F77Minuit. 
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>TRolke</h4>
New version of TRolke from J. Lundberg.
<ul>
  <li>
The interface of the class has been changed. The old user interface was very hard to use, and the documentation in the source was also not on par with the correct usage. The old interface was a single get-function with 12 arguments, and the user was supposed to figure out which ~ 5 arguments were relevant for a specific model (1 out of 7 models).
  <br>
The new user interface is is easy to use correctly and hard to use incorrectly (TM). It's a single set-method for each method:
<pre>
SetPoissonBkgBinomialEff(Int_t x,Int_t y,Int_t z,Double_t tau,Int_t m);
SetPoissonBkgGaussianEff(Int_t x,Int_t y,Double_t em, Double_t tau,Double_t sde);
SetGaussianBkgGaussianEff(Int_t x,Double_t bm,Double_t em, Double_t sde,Double_t sdb);
SetPoissondBkgknownEff(Int_t x,Int_t y,Double_t tau,Double_t e);
SetGaussianBkgknownEff(Int_t x,Double_t bm,Double_t sdb,Double_t e);
SetKnownBkgBinomialEff(Int_t x, Int_t z,Int_t m,Double_t b);
SetknownBkgGaussianEff(Int_t x,Double_t em,Double_t sde,Double_t b);
</pre>

  </li>

  <li>New methods for getting sensitivity (average limits) and related quantities and for critical number related to rejection of the null-hypothesis (no signal).
 <li>Some small Bug fixes. Some variables were used uninitialized. (Eg, input arguments which were not supposed to be used were used anyway.)

  </ul>
