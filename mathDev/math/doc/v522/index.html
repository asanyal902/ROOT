<h4>MathCore</h4>
<ul>
 <li><bf><tt>TKDTree</tt></bf>: new class for represeting a kd-tree (a k-dimensional tree). See the <a href="http://root.cern.ch/root/htmldoc/TKDTree.html">TKDTree class documentation</a> for a detailed description of the method.
  </li>
  <li>
  Fixed a bug in the <tt>ROOT::Math::landau_pdf</tt> function. Now it evaluates to the correct normalized distribution when the scale factor is different than 1.</li>
  <li><bf><tt>TVirtualFitter</tt></bf>: move TVirtualFitter from base to mathcore. Setting the minimizer parameters is done via the new class <tt>ROOT::Math::MinimizerOptions</tt>.
  <li><bf><tt>ROOT::Math::MinimizerOptions</tt></bf>: new class keeping the minimizer control parameters, minimizer name and algorithms. Static values of the parameter exist and can be set and retrieved via corresponding static methods. 
  <li><bf>Fitting Classes</bf>: improve in general all classes in view of using them in the histogram and graph fitting routines. Few bugs have been as well fixed (see the <a href="http://root.cern.ch/viewcvs?rev=25486&root=root&view=rev">cvs log</a> for details).
 </li> 
  </ul>
  <h4>Fumili</h4>
  <ul>
 <li> Add implementation of Minimizer interface using TFumili.
    </ul>
  <h4>Minuit</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
  In  <tt>TMinuitMinimizer</tt>: do not delete the contained TMinuit reference, but maintain it alife, and accessable outside as gMinuit. It can then be used after fitting, for example for drawing contour plots.
 <li>
<tt>    TLinearMinimizer</tt>: add support for robust fitting
    </li>
    </ul>
<h4>Minuit2</h4>
    <ul>
 <li><tt>DavidonErrorUpdator</tt>: add an additonal check to avoid a divison by zero.
 <li>In <tt>Minuit2Minimizer</tt> fill the status information according to the minimizer result
      </ul>

  <h4>GenVector</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Change the way the exception are thrown in the package (class <tt>GenVector_exception</tt>). Now, the GenVector_exception class is created only when the throwing of exception is enabled. This avoids the allocation of an un-needed <tt>std::string</tt>. This problem was observed in CMS when converting from 4D-vectors based on mass  to standard (x,y,z,t) vectors, when the mass is zero. In this case, a numerical error creates artifically small negative masses returned by the (x,y,z,t) vector. Eventually a protection could be added when calcuting M2(), to avoid negative values due to numerical rounding.
  </li>  
 <li>Fix a problem in the assignment operator of the <tt>ROOT::Math::PxPyPzM4D</tt> class. Avoid having nan when converting for example from PxPyPzME4D to PxPyPzM4D when the mass is negative. </li> 
<li>Throw always exception in the non-supported setters (i.e. SetPt on a PxPyPzEVector) methods, which are generated only for the CINT dictionary. These methods flag a compiled-error when running in C++ mode.</li>
</ul>
