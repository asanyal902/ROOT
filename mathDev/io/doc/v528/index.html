<h3>I/O</h3>
<h4>TFile::MakeProject</h4>
Extend TFile::MakeProject to support genreflex, cases of user's data model where
the 2 distincts pointers point to a single object and more cases where we are 
missing the StreamerInfo and need to guess whether the symbol represent an enum,
a class or a namespace.

To use genreflex, call MakeProject with the "genreflex" option, for example:
<pre style="border:gray 1px solid;padding:0.5em 2em;background:#ffe">
   file->MakeProject(libdir,"*","NEW+genreflex");
</pre>
To make sure the library created by MakeProject does not double delete an object,
tell the StreamerElement representing one of the pointers pointing to the object
to never delete the object.  For example:

<pre style="border:gray 1px solid;padding:0.5em 2em;background:#ffe">
   TClass::AddRule("HepMC::GenVertex m_event attributes=NotOwner");
</pre>

MakeProject now implements a move constructor for each classes.   For the implementation, we 'use' the 'copy constructor' until the C++ compilers properly support the official move constructor notation.   Implementing a move constructor avoid having to delete and reconstruct resource during a std::vector resize and avoid the double delete induced by using the default copy constructor.

<h4>Misc.</h4>
<ul><li>To make sure that the class emulation layer of ROOT does not double delete an object,
tell the StreamerElement representing one of the pointers pointing to the object
to never delete the object.  For example:

<pre style="border:gray 1px solid;padding:0.5em 2em;background:#ffe">
   TClass::AddRule("HepMC::GenVertex m_event attributes=NotOwner");
</pre>
</li>
<li>The handling of memory by the collection proxy has been improved in the case of a 
collection of pointers which can now become owner of its content.<p/>

The default, for backward compatibility reasons and to avoid double delete (at the expense
of memory leaks), the container of pointers are <em>still</em> not owning their content
<em>unless</em> they are a free standing container (i.e. itself not contained in another
object).<p/>
To make a container of pointers become owner of its content do something like:
<pre style="border:gray 1px solid;padding:0.5em 2em;background:#ffe">
      TClass::AddRule("ObjectVector<LHCb::MCRichDigitSummary> m_vector options=Owner");
</pre>
For MakeProject, use file->GetStreamerInfoCache() instead of the TClass GetStreamerInfo.
</li>
<ul>
