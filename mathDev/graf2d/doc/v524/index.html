<h3>Graphical Output</h3>

<h4>TASImage / libAfterImage</h4>
<ul>

<li> In <tt>TImageDump</tt> the way the markers 6 and 7 are drawn 
     (medium dot and big dot) has been changed to make sure they have
     the same size as the one on screen.
<li> Changes in libAfterImage (draw.c & draw.h), TASImage.cxx
     and TImageDump.cxx in order to produce nice looking 
     circular (hollow and solid) markers. Previously the line 
     used to draw hollow circular markers looked very thick and 
     the solid ones did not look circular.
<li> Remove the global variable named "dpy" in libAfterImage. It produced
     an error if a user program used that simple variable name. "dpy"
     was a pointer to a "Display".
</ul>

<h4>PostScript and PDF</h4>
<ul>
<li> Now, a text with size 0 is not drawn in PDF files. An invalid
     PDF file is created if a text with size 0 is produced.
</ul>

<h4>TLegend</h4>
<ul>
<li> When a object is added "by name" in a legend, the
  TMultiGraph and THStack present in the current pad
  are scanned if an object with this name has not been
  found in the pad. Previously the graphs and histograms
  were hidden in multi-graphs and histogram-stacks when one
  tried to add them by name.
<li> New reference guide.
</ul>

<h4>TCrown</h4>
<ul>
<li> The crown picking did not work.
<li> Improve help.
</ul>

<h4>TCanvas</h4>
<ul>
<li> A canvas is turned into GL mode only if the
  canvas name starts with "gl". Before the
  "gl" string could be anywhere in the name.
</ul>
