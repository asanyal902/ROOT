short: Converters of GEANT and HBOOK files into ROOT files
long:
This package provides two utilities for converting old ZEBRA files
into ROOT structures in ROOT files. h2root converts an HBOOK
file, containing histograms and/or NTuples, into ROOT files with
histograms and/or trees (TNtuple). g2root converts GEANT3 geometries
into ROOT TGeometry geometries. This package also contains the
libHbook library that allows the reading of HBOOK file and on the
fly conversion of HBOOK histograms and ntuples (RWN and CWN).
