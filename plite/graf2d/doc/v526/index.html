<h3>Graphical Output</h3>

<h4>PostScript and PDF</h4>
<ul>
<li> In the following macro the minus sign was not correct:
   <pre>
   {
      TCanvas *c = new TCanvas;
      TLatex *l = new TLatex(0.5, 0.5, "#font[122]{a = b + c - d #pm e}");
      l->Draw();
      c->SaveAs("c.eps");
    }
    </pre>
    The font 122 is the greek one. With a such TLatex "a" becomes "alpha", 
    "b" becomes " beta" etc ... It is not the recommended way to do greek
    characters with TLatex, but it should work anyway.
</ul>

<h4>TASImage</h4>
<ul> The text size adjustment applied <tt>TASImage::DrawText</tt>
  was not valid (scale factor of 1.044). The text size was wrong and the 
  following macro produced a wrong title when ran in batch:
  <pre>
  {
     TCanvas *canvas = new TCanvas("c5","c5",900,900);
     TH1F *histo = new TH1F("Histo","123456x_{i}abcdefy^{2}",100,0,20);
     canvas->Print("drawing.gif");
  }
  </pre>
</ul>

<h3>Graphics Primitives</h3>

<h4>New class TGraphTime</h4>
TGraphTime is used to draw a set of objects evolving with nsteps in time between tmin and tmax.
each time step has a new list of objects. This list can be identical to
the list of objects in the previous steps, but with different attributes.
   see example of use in $ROOTSYS/tutorials/graphs/gtime.C

<h4>TLatex</h4>
<ul>
<li> In the following macro the <tt>#int</tt> and <tt>#sum</tt> symbols had 
     wrong limits placement if the character just before started with "#".
   <pre>
   {
      TCanvas *c1 = new TCanvas("c1","c1",500,500);
      TLatex l;
      l.SetTextSize(0.1);

      l.DrawLatex(0.1,0.6,"#nu#int^{1-x}_{2#pi}");
      l.DrawLatex(0.1,0.2,"a#int^{1-x}_{2#pi}");

      l.DrawLatex(0.5,0.6,"#nu#sum^{1-x}_{2#pi}");
      l.DrawLatex(0.5,0.2,"a#sum^{1-x}_{2#pi}");
   }
   </pre>

   This problem is there since the 1st version of TLatex. It is fixed by:
   <ol>
   <li>Giving "^" and "_" a lower precedence than special and greek characters.
   <li>Making a special case for #int and #sum and giving them even
      lower precedence than "^" and "_". 
   </ol>
   Oleksandr Grebenyuk <tt><ogrebenyuk@lbl.gov></tt> helped a lot solving this 
   issue.
</ul>

</h4>TMarker</h4>
<ul>
<li> The markers picking now takes into account the marker size. This is
     useful for big markers, because there is no need to pick exactly the 
     marker's center.
</ul>
