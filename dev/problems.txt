1. ProfileLikelihoodCalculator Poisson -> lower limit goes to 0 when minValue for mean is 0 or very small
   -> it seems there is a problem with the calculated error matrix -> gives wrong error for estimate
2. RooUnitTest -> comparison error message is not suggestive; it tells us which values are different, not the names of the variables which have different values
3. ProfileLikelihoodCalculator Poisson -> observed Value = 500 gives Minimization failure; This only happens when the true mean has small values
4. BayesianCalculator -> priorPOI argument should be priorPdf IMO
5. getAnalyticalIntegrator -> not suggestive at all
	analyticalIntegrator -> should be private
6. createIntegral for discrete Poisson for range [a,b] sums from a to b-1; maybe this should be better documented
7. the RooIntegrator1D problem
	- RooRealIntegral:62 Minimum number of steps -> solves convergence problem
	- however the integrator has a very long running time, because of too many function calls (see Mathcore integration tests)
8. TestBayesianCalculator1 is quite lengthy even for small mean intervals
9. Problem with importing libraries; sometimes you have to declare something in RooFit (for example, create a RooGaussian) so that libRooFit is imported
10. HypoTestInverter -> SetModel does nothing in the current version
11. HypoTestInverter -> if pdf given is not extended should automatically set the number of events per toy in ToyMcSampler using the DataSet size
12. HypoTestInverter -> auto scan does not work... it gets stuck in an infinite loop at the upper limit
13. HypoTestInverter -> in fixed scans, sometimes the upper limit of the signal range is scanned twice
14. HypoTestInverter -> SetFixedScan breaks the HypoTestInverter for certain value (we get wrong interval limits); this is currently caught by TestHypoTestInverter
15. HypoTestInverter AsymptoticCalculator - the MIGRAD minimization messages cannot be hidden
16. HypoTestInverter AsymptoticCalculator gives different results compared to the other two calculators
17. HypoTestInverter - I passed the SBModel argument for the BModel parameter and viceversa and it worked - Why?
18. HypoTestCalculator -> ProfileLikelihoodTestStat and RatioOfProfiledLikelihoodTestStat not working
