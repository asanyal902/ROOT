CRITICAL

1. HypoTestInverter -> SetModel does nothing in the current version
2. HypoTestInverter -> if pdf given is not extended should automatically set the number of events per toy in ToyMcSampler using the DataSet size
3. HypoTestInverter -> auto scan does not work... it gets stuck in an infinite loop at the upper limit
4. HypoTestInverter -> in fixed scans, sometimes the upper limit of the signal range is scanned twice
5. HypoTestInverter -> SetFixedScan breaks the HypoTestInverter for certain value (we get wrong interval limits); this is currently caught by TestHypoTestInverter
6. HypoTestInverter AsymptoticCalculator - the MIGRAD minimization messages cannot be hidden
7. HypoTestInverter AsymptoticCalculator gives different results compared to the other two calculators
8. SamplingDistribution.cxx line 547 : if fNuisanceParametersSampler is not set, the weight is set to -1.0. This yields negative error values when using FrequentistCalculator. Should the weight have a different value (e.g. 1.0) or should we force setting nuisance parameters in the models?


MAJOR

1. RooUnitTest -> comparison error message is not suggestive; it tells us which values are different, not the names of the variables which have different values
2. BayesianCalculator -> priorPOI argument should be POIpriorPdf IMHO
3. Problem with importing libraries; sometimes you have to declare something in RooFit (for example, create a RooGaussian) so that libRooFit is imported

MINOR / WEAKLY RELATED

1. getAnalyticalIntegrator -> not suggestive at all
	analyticalIntegrator -> should be private
2. createIntegral for discrete Poisson for range [a,b] sums from a to b-1; maybe this should be better documented
3. the RooIntegrator1D problem
	- RooRealIntegral:62 Minimum number of steps -> solves convergence problem
	- however the integrator has a very long running time, because of too many function calls (see Mathcore integration tests)
