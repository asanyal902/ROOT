<h3>OpenGL</h3>

<ul>

<li> It is now possible to draw a histogram with the "GLBOX" in the
GL-viewer.

<li> New class <tt>TGLAnnotation</tt> - it allows display of
annotation-text on top of displayed objects.

The annotation can be created from the <tt>TGLViewer</tt> editor
("Guides" tab). After that it can be dragged around the screen, edited
or closed.

<li> <tt>TGLAxisPainter</tt> - reimplemented to completely separate
label and tick-mark positioning code from the rendering itself.

<li> <tt>TGLSAViewer</tt> - when exporting an image properly take into
account image extension if it was typed by the user.

<li> <tt>TGLFont</tt> now uses the same font-naming scheme as the rest
of ROOT (had to specify font-file names before).

</ul>

<h3>Eve</h3>

<ul>

<li> <tt>TEveElement</tt> - add context-menu functions allowing the
source-object to be printed, dumped or exported to CINT.

<li> <tt>TEveTrack</tt> - added flag for locking of current
track-points - the track will not be re-extrapolated automatically
even when the extrapolation parameters are changed.

<li> <tt>TEveTrack</tt> - removed ALICE specific <tt>ImportXyzz()</tt>
functions for loading of kinematics, hits and clusters associated with
a track. These were calling macros that were not available in ROOT.

<li> Several improvements in rendering of coordinate axes
in <tt>TEveCaloLego</tt> and <tt>TEveProjectionAxes</tt>.

<li> New class <tt>TEveJetCone</tt> for display of jet-cones clipped
to the calorimeter's inner surface.

</ul>
