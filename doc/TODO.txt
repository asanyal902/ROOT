For December 2010 release (5.28):

* make it easier for the user to understand that makeclass is not implemented.
  even an non-implemented makeclass creates a huge c-code output (which is garbage) 
  We have not implemented makeclass for the following classes: 
  BayesClassifier CFMlpANN Committee Cuts KNN PDERS RuleFit SVM PDEFoam

* unit test breaks with makeclass and LikelihoodD, LikelihoodPCA, LikelihoodMix, HMatrix (generell tendency of breaks with preprocessing)
* regression mit MLP und backpropagation (BP)
* unit test breaks mit BDT
* unit test breaks von Event::SetWeight
* MulticlassApplication.C breaks (while identical .cxx version works)
* Parallel coordinates crashes
* Problem im CreateMvaPDF for Fisher
* crash of: root -l TMVAClassificationApplication.C\(\"LD\"\) (.cxx version works)
