<h3>PROOF</h3>
<ul>
  <li>A few fixes to run the TProofCondor plug-in:
  <ul>
    <li>Adapt the signatures of the main constructors of TProofCondor 
and TProofPEAC
(and of the related plug-in handlers) to the one of TProof.</li>
    <li>Add the possibility to trigger the load of a generic 
TProof-derived plug-in via
a directive the xrootd config file 'xpd.proofplugin', e.g. 
'xpd.proofplugin condor:'</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Packetizer parameters
  <ul>
    <li>The type of "PROOF_MaxSlavesPerNode",
&nbsp;"PROOF_ForceLocal" and
&nbsp;"PROOF_PacketAsAFraction" parameters has been changed from Long_t to Int_t.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>The max workers per node can now be also set in the xrootd config file with<br clear="all">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;xpd.putrc&nbsp; Packetizer.MaxWorkersPerNode: &lt;desired number&gt;</li>
  </ul></li>
</ul>
