Version 3.0.4
-------------

+ **New features**
   * xrdcp now has -version parameter
   * xrdcp automatically ads the oss.asize hint to the url opaque data
   * RPM: devel package split into libs-devel, client-devel and server-devel
   * XrootdFS: all paramenters can be passed via command line, add -h.
   * Allow a plugin (notably the proxy plugin) to disable async I/O.

+ **Major bug fixes**
   * Async write errors are now being properly caught and reacted to.
     XrdClient::Close will now fail if it cannot recover from async
     write errors.
   * xrdcp prints an error message and returns failure to the shell
     when some of the write requests it issues fail.
   * libXrdPosixPreload now builds with autotools and is included into
     the xrootd-client RPM
   * RPM: FFS moved from libs to client
   * Properly parse oss.asize. This because a major problem when xrdcp started
     adding this to the url which causes the copy to fail.
   * Spin connection portion of proxy initialization to a background thread.
     This prevents init.d hangs when a redirector is not available.

+ **Minor bug fixes**
   * Test for 64-bit atomics instead 32-bit ones. Fixes build on 32-bit PowerPC.
   * RPM: xrootd-fuse now depends on fuse
