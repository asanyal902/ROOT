<p>
Python 3 now has some basic support.
Problems remain with the impedance mismatch between Python 3's pervasive use
of unicode, versus the more common basic strings in C++, and the renewed buffer
interface.
The former means that char* as byte* will lead to problems, the latter means
that arrays are currently not supported at all.

<p>
Significant changes to equality and non-equality operatores should make their
behavior more consistent across the board.
