<ul>
<li>
With option COL <tt>TProfile2D</tt> histograms are handled differently because, for this type of 2D
histograms, it is possible to know if an empty bin has been filled or not. So even
if all the bins' contents are positive some empty bins might be painted. And vice versa,
if some bins have a negative content some empty bins might be not painted.
</li>
<li>
Make sure the 2D drawing options COL, ARR, CONT and BOX are ignored when used to
plot a 1D histogram. 1D histograms plotted with one of these options is now drawn
with the default 1D plotting option. This is useful when the default option in the
TBrowser is, for instance, COL. Before this change the 1D histogram appeared as blank.

<li>
New plotting option <tt>"LEGO3"</tt>.cw
 Like the option <tt>"LEGO1"</tt>, the option <tt>"LEGO3"</tt> 
draws a lego plot using the hidden surface removal technique but doesn't draw
the border lines of each individual lego-bar. This is very useful for histograms
having many bins. With such histograms the option <tt>"LEGO1"</tt> gives a black
image because of the border lines. This option also works with stacked legos.

When drawn with option SAME the histogram 1st and last bins might be wrong.
The following macro shows the problem:
<pre>
   {
   TCanvas *c = new TCanvas("c","c",900,900);
   c->Divide (1,2);
   
   TH1D * histo1 = new TH1D ("histo1","histo1",100,0.,100.) ;
   histo1->SetBinContent(51,80.) ;
   
   TH1D * histo2 = new TH1D ("histo2","histo2",100,49.9,51.1) ;  /// not ok
   histo2->SetMinimum(0.) ; histo2->SetMaximum(100.) ;
   
   c->cd(1); gPad->DrawFrame(49.9, 0., 51.1, 100);
   histo1->Draw("same");
   
   Double_t xAxis[4] = {3., 5., 7., 9.};
   TH1D *histo2 = new TH1D("histo","",3, xAxis);
   histo2->SetBinContent(1,2.);
   histo2->SetBinContent(2,4.);
   histo2->SetBinContent(3,3.);
   
   c->cd(2); gPad->DrawFrame(4.,0., 10.,5.);
   histo2->Draw("same");
}
</pre>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>TPaletteAxis</h3>
<ul>
<li>
The histogram Z axis title is now painted along the palette axis.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>TH2, TH3</h3>
<ul>
<li>
Update Projection methods of both TH2 and TH3 to not return a null pointer when an histogram with the same name already existed and it was not compatible.
Now just set the new correct binning on the previously existing histogram.   
</li>
</ul>
