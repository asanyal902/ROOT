<h3>Histogram package</h3>

  The <em>libHist</em> library now depends on <em>libMathCore</em> which must be linked whenever one needs to use the histogram library.
<br>

<h4>TF1</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
  The code used for implementing numerical methods like <tt>TF1::Integration</tt> or <tt>TF1::Derivation</tt> or <tt>TF1::GetX</tt> has now been now moved in MathCore and used to implement corresponding classes like <tt>GaussIntegrator</tt> or <tt>BrentRootFinder</tt>. The impementation remains however the same.</li>
  <li>A new method <tt>TF1::operator()(double x, double y=0, double z)</tt> which is equivalent to <tt>TF1::Eval</tt> has been added for using TF1 as a callable object.</li>
  <li>New templated methods <tt>TF1::SetFunction</tt> for generic C++ callable objects or for class member functions.</li>
</ul>


<h4>TH1</h4>

<ul>
<li> Fixed a bug in the <tt>TH1::KolmogorovTest</tt> function in the case of scaled or weighted  histograms. The routine has been improved and 
now could also be used for comparing an histogram with a function if it is represented as an histogram with zero errors (equivalent to the case of options "F1" or "F2" in the original HDIFF routine of HBOOK).</li>
<li>Improved the <tt>TH1::Chi2Test</tt> for the treatment of empty bins in the histograms. If both histograms have one empty bin, the number of degree of freedom is decreased by one but the test is performed without reporting an error. If only one histogram is having an empty bin it is considered in the comparison.  
</ul>


<h4>TH2</h4>

<ul>
<li>
Improve <tt>TH2::FitFitSliceX</tt> and <tt>TH2::FitFitSliceY</tt> by adding the possibility to return the generated histograms in a TObjArray when the passed pointer is not null.
</li>
</ul>

<h4>TH3</h4>

<ul>
<li>
Fixed a bug in <tt>TH3::Project3DProfile</tt>. 
</li>
</ul>

<h4>TProfile and TProfile2D</h4>

<ul>
<li>
Add a new option "W" in <tt>TProfile::ProjectionX</tt> and <tt>TProfile::ProjectionXY</tt> to be able to return the equivalent weighted filled histogram. Its bin content is equal to the profile bin content multiplied by the bin entries.
</li>
</ul>


<h4>THnSparse</h4>
<ul>
<li>Implement <tt>THnSparse::Projection</tt> and <tt>THnSparse::Merge</tt>

</ul>
