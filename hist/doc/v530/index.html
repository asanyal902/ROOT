<h3>Histogram package</h3>

<h4>THistPainter</h4>
<ul>
<li><tt>TPad::SetTheta()</tt> and <tt>TPad::SetPhi()</tt> did not cause the
canvas redrawing.</li>
<li> Protection added in case two histograms were plotted in the same pad
using the option BOX (the 2nd one with option SAME).
The clipping was not correct when an interactive zoom was performed.
</li>
</ul>

<h4>TH2Poly</h4>
<ul>
<li> <tt>Add(const TH1 *h1, Double_t c1)</tt> has been implemented.</li>
<li> <tt>Reset()</tt> has been implemented.</li>
<li> The destructor has been completed.</li>
</ul>

<h4>TGraphErrors</h4>
<ul>
<li>The following macro generated wrong C++ code.
<pre>
{
   TGraphErrors *ge = new TGraphErrors(2);
   ge->SetName("aaa");    // <<< without this it works
   ge->SetPoint(1, 1, 1); ge->SetPoint(2, 2, 1);
   ge->Draw("ap*");
   gPad->Update();
   ge->SavePrimitive(cout);
}
</pre>
</li>
</ul>
