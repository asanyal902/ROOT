<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>In this session you will learn about scopes, what constructors and assignment operators do, and how to draw histograms and change their style.<p/>
<p>You need to download the code from <a href="../1.tar.bz2">1.tar.bz2</a> and then run</p>
<pre>tar xjf 1.tar.bz2
cd 1</pre>
<p>These are your exercises for this session:</p>
<ol>
  <li class="lvl1">Scopes
    <ol>
      <li><p>Run the macro <a href="histogram.C" class="source">histogram.C</a>.
      It is supposed to display a histogram, but something is wrong.
      Fix the macro so the histogram gets displayed.</p>
      <a href="help11.html" class="help1">HELP!</a></li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li class="lvl1">Constructors and alike
    <ol>    
      <li><p>Execute the macro <a href="test_motorcycle.C" class="source">test_motorcycle.C</a>.
      This macro creates and loads a library containing the class <tt>TMotorcycle</tt>, which
      is defined in <a href="Motorcycle.h" class="source">Motorcycle.h</a> and
      <a href="Motorcycle.C" class="source">Motorcycle.C</a>.
      <a href="test_motorcycle.C" class="source">test_motorcycle.C</a> is very inefficient - and
      your assignment is to figure out why. To do that, count how many times the constructor,
      copy constructor, assignment operator and destructor are called. You should modify
      <a href="Motorcycle.C" class="source">Motorcycle.C</a>
      for that.</p>
      <p>The copy constructor and assignment operator can be extremely expensive,
      e.g. for large vectors of large objects,
      so it is important to learn how to write code that avoids their invocation.</p>
      <a href="help21.html" class="help1">HELP!</a></li>

      <li><p>We continue to use <a href="test_motorcycle.C" class="source">test_motorcycle.C</a>.
      As you can see the macro has a bug - instead of five motorcycles it only displays one kind
      of motorcycles. Fix that!</p>

  </li>
  <li class="lvl1">Drawing and Editing Histograms
    <ol>
      <li><p>Execute <a href="ages.C" class="source">ages.C</a>.
      It creates and displays a histogram showing the age distribution of the participants of a CSC.
      Use the editor (in the TCanvas's menu under View &gt; Editor) to make the histogram look like this one:</p>
      <p><img src="ages.png" class="default" alt="goal histogram from ages.C"></p>
      <a href="help41.html" class="help1">HELP!</a></li>
      <li><p>Save the histogram to <tt>styledhist.C</tt>
      (e.g. see the Canvas's file menu, or right-click the histogram)
      and look at that saved file.
      Restart ROOT and run <tt>styleshist.C</tt> to check that ROOT really
      does store the histogram as C++ code.</p>
      <a href="help51.html" class="help1">HELP!</a></li>
      <li><p>The style settings you set with the editor are preserved in the .C file.
      Identify and use the function calls in <tt>styleshist.C</tt> to change ages.C
      such that it displays the histogram styled like the example picture above.</p>
