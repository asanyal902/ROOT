<h1>ROOT Exercise I - Help Level 1</h1>
<p>Got stuck? This might help:</p>
<h2>2 Constructors and alike</h2>

<div class="exercise">
TMotorcycle prints whenever its constructor or assignment operator etc are called.
Why did that (mostly) stop when you fixed the macro?
</div>

<p>You probably changed all the variables of type <tt>TMotorcycle</tt>
into variables of type <tt>TMotorcycle*</tt>.
Before you passed objects around, which got copied again and again,
which in turn invokes the assignment operator and the copy constructor etc.
How does converting to pointers help here?</p>
