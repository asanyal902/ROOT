<h1>ROOT Exercise III - Help Level 2</h1>
<p>Got stuck? This might help even more:</p>
<h2>2 My First TSelector</h2>

<div class="exercise">
Actually you have more than just one file - the tree is spread over several ROOT files.
So you want to create a TChain from them all.
How much time of data taking does the tree from all the <tt>beamspot*.root</tt> files correspond to?
</div>

<p>To create a chain of all files called <tt>beamspot*.root</tt> you create a new TChain object,
passing the trees' name, and the add the files using a wildcard.
What you want to draw is the time.
You could start with drawing the date itself, by drawing the expression <tt>"eventinfo.fTime"</tt>.
You will see that the axis labels are wrong; you might want to submit a bug report at http://root.cern.ch!
Either way, this is not very informative - the time span is just too short; it's all on 2008-06-23, within the minute 16:05.
To get more detail, draw the seconds and microseconds!
eventinfo.fTime is a TDatime object which is part of ROOT; check its documentation on how to get the seconds from it.
The microseconds are part of the tree itself.</p>

<p>You will see that the last bin is not completely filled.
The reason is that the bin goes from e.g. 50.5 to 51.0 seconds,
but the events only go up to maybe 50.2 seconds.
If we have 1000 events per second, and if all bins are 0.5 second wide,
then each bin has 500 entries - but the last one will have only 200 entries
if data taking stopped at 50.2 seconds.
The same is valid for the first bin</p>

<p>Do you manage to find out exactly when the first and last event occurred?</p>
