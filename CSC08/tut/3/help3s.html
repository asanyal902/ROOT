<h1>ROOT Exercise III - Solution</h1>
<p>Got stuck? This is the solution</p>
<h2>2 My First TSelector</h2>

<div class="exercise">
Explore the tree in <a href="beamspot.root" class="source">beamspot.root</a>.
It contains the position of the primary collision of the beam's particles
("vertex 0" or "primary vertex") for a virtual experiment.
The position is stored in centimeters relative to the center of the detector.
For each position (x|y|z) the tree also denotes the time stamp of the collision,
where everything (year up to second) is in one branch,
and the fractions of seconds are stored in another branch.
What branches does it have? What is its structure?
</div>

<p>The following code is one way of retrieving the information you are looking for:</p>
<pre>
TFile* f = new TFile("beamspot.root"); // open the file
f-&gt;ls(); // the tree is called "tree3"
TTree* t = (TTree*) f-&gt;Get("tree3"); // extract the tree
t-&gt;Print(); // dump the tree's structure
</pre>
