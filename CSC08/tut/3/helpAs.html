<h1>ROOT Exercise III - Solution</h1>
<p>Got stuck? This is the solution</p>
<h2>Running a TSelector with PROOF <em>[OPTIONAL!]</em> </h2>

<div class="exercise">
<p>Can you find out why PROOF spawns the amount of workers it does (it should be two)?</p>
</div>

<p>When starting Proof on the localhost, a session with a number of workers equal to the number 
of CPUs in your machine will be started. As you have dual-core machines, it starts two workers:</p>

<pre>
root [0] TProof::Open("localhost")
Starting master: opening connection ...
Starting master: OK
Opening connections to workers: OK (2 workers)
Setting up worker servers: OK (2 workers)
PROOF set to parallel mode (2 workers)
(class TProof*)0x11e77b0
root [1]
</pre>
