<h1>ROOT Exercise III - Solution</h1>
<p>Got stuck? This is the solution</p>
<h2>2 PROOF</h2>

<div class="exercise">
<p>That worked, and it was faster - but it wasn't impressively fast.
	  What about running the same selector on a whole cluster?
	  We have set up a PROOF cluster for you: it uses one core of all the exercise machines.
	  Depending on when you get here the PROOF cluster might be pretty busy or completely empty,
	  and you will get a performance improvement that depends on the available resources.</p>
	  <p>So let's run it! The PROOF master is called <tt>"server"</tt>. Any speed difference?</p>
</div>

<p>To start PROOF run <tt>TProof::Open("server")</tt>.
It will tell you the number of nodes that it connected for you.
Then inform the <tt>TChain</tt> that it should use PROOF,
e.g. by adding the line <tt>ch->SetProof()</tt> to your chain setup script.
Now you run the selector like before: <tt>ch->Process(...)</tt> and it will use PROOF!
