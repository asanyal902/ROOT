<h1>ROOT Exercise III</h1>
<p>When you are done with today's exercise, you can help your colleagues...</p>
<ul>
  <li class="lvl1">Exercise I: The Basics.</li>
  <li class="lvl1">Exercise II: I/O and Trees.</li>
  <li class="lvl1"><span class="today">Exercise III: Tree-Based Analysis.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>In this session you will learn how to analyze trees.<p/>
<p>You need to download the code from <a href="../3.tar.bz2">3.tar.bz2</a> and then run</p>
<pre>tar xjf 3.tar.bz2
cd 3</pre>
<p>These are your exercises for this session:</p>
<ol>

  <li class="lvl1">My First TSelector
    <ol>    
      <li><p>We have created a selector (starting from the output of <tt>TTree::MakeSelector()</tt>) for you;
	  see the files <a href="TPosCorr.h" class="source">TPosCorr.h</a> and <a href="TPosCorr.C" class="source">TPosCorr.C</a>.
	  Run it on the TTree MyTree spread over the files</p>
	  <pre>
	  http://server/exercise3.root
	  http://server/exercise3_1.root
	  http://server/exercise3_2.root
	  http://server/exercise3_3.root
	  http://server/exercise3_4.root
	  http://server/exercise3_5.root
	  http://server/exercise3_6.root
	  http://server/exercise3_7.root
	  http://server/exercise3_8.root
	  http://server/exercise3_9.root
	  http://server/exercise3_10.root
	  </pre>
	  <p>Run the selector in compiled mode on the whole tree.</p>
      <a href="help11.html" class="help1">HELP!</a></li>

      <li><p>That worked, but it wasn't impressively fast. What about running the same selector on PROOF?
	  We have set up a PROOF cluster for you - you are sitting in front of it.
	  During the first exercise, you all used one core of your machine.
	  PROOF is configured to use one core of your machine, too - but on all machines!
	  Depending on when you get here the PROOF cluster might be pretty busy or completely empty,
	  and you will get a performance improvement that depends on the available resources.</p>
	  <p>So let's run it! The PROOF master is called <tt>"server"</tt>. Any speed difference?</p>
      <a href="help21.html" class="help1">HELP!</a></li>
	  
      <li><p>.</p>
      <a href="help91.html" class="help1">HELP!</a></li>

      <li><p>Can you find out why PROOF spawns the amount of workers it does (it should be two)?</p>
      <a href="helpA1.html" class="help1">HELP!</a></li>

      <li><p>Try to change the number of workers on your computer (e.g set up 6 workers).</p>

<h2>
Selector: draw complex var (i.e. lots of trogonometrics, loops, correlations, maybe a minimization!) but only small events (little I/O)
New TTree spread over several TFiles (TChain) accessible via http.

If Quad-Core: 2 cores for proof cluster; test selector on local, proof lite, proof cluster.
