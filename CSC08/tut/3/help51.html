<h1>ROOT Exercise III - Help Level 1</h1>
<p>Got stuck? This might help:</p>
<h2>2 PROOF</h2>

<div class="exercise">
      <p>That was fast, right? Now let's do it interactively. Quit ROOT and start it again.
	  Simply run <tt>TProof::Open()</tt>. The GUI will allow you to do the same as in the previous exercise.
	  Once the selector has run, look at the histograms that are displayed: there are plenty of PROOF statistics like
	  the number of events per node.	  
	  </p>
</div>

<p>
	  Connect to the master called server (the session name is arbitrary),
      then you create a new query (that's the selector's context).
	  The "new query" window allows you to call the chain creation macro if you have not yet createed the TChain object.
	  And of course it allows you to select the selector.
