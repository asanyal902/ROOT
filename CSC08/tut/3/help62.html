<h1>ROOT Exercise III - Help Level 2</h1>
<p>Got stuck? This might help even more:</p>
<h2>2 My First TSelector</h2>

<div class="exercise">
One of the experiment's students is a notorious party animal.
One day he had to fix a cable close to the detector,
but because he didn't have enough sleep he stumbled and fell.
Of course he didn't tell anyone - but can you find out the exact time when it happened?
Can you tell what has happened, maybe even (roughly) where he was working?
Only that much: it happened during the period of time that you have data for.
</div>

<p>You should look at the Z position vs. the time.
The selector TBeamSpotSel already stores that in the histogram hBeamSpotZ_Time, so just plot that.
As we said in the lecture, plotting should be done in Terminate.
We extract the histogram from the output list (instead of just using fBeamSpotZ_Time) because that is how we can extract results obtained via PROOF.</p>
<p>When looking at the distribution of the Z position you will notice a sudden change at a certain time stamp.
This means the the beam position as seen by the experiment has moved.
A possible cause could be the student.</p>
<p>Could he have moved the beam? Unlikely.</p>
<p>Could he have moved the experiment? Maybe - if it's not too big...
So where would he have to be standing to move the experiment in Z by falling?
In the Z position next to the experiment!</p>

<p>Do you manage to find out exactly when the first and last event occurred?</p>
