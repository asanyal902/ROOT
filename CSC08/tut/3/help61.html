<h1>ROOT Exercise III - Help Level 1</h1>
<p>Got stuck? This might help:</p>
<h2>2 My First TSelector</h2>

<div class="exercise">
One of the experiment's students is a notorious party animal.
One day he had to fix a cable close to the detector,
but because he didn't have enough sleep he stumbled and fell.
Of course he didn't tell anyone - but can you find out the exact time when it happened?
Can you tell what has happened, maybe even (roughly) where he was working?
Only that much: it happened during the period of time that you have data for.
</div>

<p>You are looking for some change in the data you have.
It might be X, Y, Z, or all of them, and it has happened at a certain time.
So you should probably look at the time dependence of the data you have.
Check the selector we provided to you; it fills more histograms than it shows, so maybe you just need to draw a few different / more histograms.
