<h1>ROOT Exercise III - Help Level 1</h1>
<p>Got stuck? This might help:</p>
<h2>2 My First TSelector</h2>

<div class="exercise">
A beam's particles are not always colliding at the same position, even without external contributions.
What is the width of the beam for this experiment, in x, y, and z?
Does it change over time?
</div>

<p>To see the width in x, y, and z you might want to simply draw the distribution of x, the distribution of y, and the distribution of z.
You know that the detector was moved at a certain time, so better select only the time before or only the time after.
You could create two histograms for each dimension, one containing the beam positions before the move of the detector and one after.
If the widths are the same before and after you can assume that the width doesn't change (much) over time.</p>
