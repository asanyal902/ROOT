<h1>ROOT Exercise III - Help Level 1</h1>
<p>Got stuck? This might help:</p>
<h2>1 Split Level</h2>

<div class="exercise">
Run the macro <a href="exercise3.C" class="source">exercise3.C</a>
in compiled mode.
We, Bertand and Axel, have used that macro to generate yesterday's tree.
Note the ROOT file's compression factor.
Note the time it takes to write the tree by using the same mechanism as in 
<a href="read_tree.C" class="source">read_tree.C</a> from yesterday,
which we have included in today's sources again for your convenience.
</div>

<p>You should run both macros in compiled mode by adding a "+" at the end.
<tt>gROOT-&gt;Time()</tt> is an easy way to determine how long things take,
see read_tree.C where it's used, too.
Just surround the relevant part in exercise3.C by calls to <tt>gROOT-&gt;Time()</tt>
such that you get the time it takes to write the ROOT file.</p>
<p>You can access the current file using the global <tt>gFile</tt>.
Check the documentation of <a href="http://root.cern.ch/root/html520/TFile.html"><tt>TFile</tt></a>
to see the function returning the compression factor<p>
