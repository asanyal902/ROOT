<h1>ROOT Exercise II - Help Level 1</h1>
<p>Got stuck? This might help:</p>
<h2>2 Reading a Tree </h2>

<div class="exercise">
<p>To accelerate the I/O for the non-split tree, we now enable <tt>TTree</tt>'s pre-fetch mechanism, confusingly called
      'cache'. This is disabled by default; use the documentation to find out how to enable it. Use <tt>TTree::Draw()</tt> of the
      same expression again (on the non-split tree). Do you notice any timing differences?</p>
</div>

<p><a href="http://root.cern.ch/root/html/TTree.html">Here is the documentation for TTree</a>.
But it won't help you very much - it does not explicitly state how to enable the prefetching of data.
(This will be fixed!) The trick is to simply call <tt>TTree::SetCacheSize()</tt> once!
Put that line into your macro, of course after you have retrieved the <tt>TTree*</tt> and before you have read the first entry.
Then simply run the macro again.</p>
