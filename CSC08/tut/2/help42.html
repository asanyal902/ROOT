<h1>ROOT Exercise II - Help Level 2</h1>
<p>Got stuck? This might help even more:</p>
<h2>1 Reading a TTree</h2>

<div class="exercise">
Looking at the macro you probably saw that it reads the ROOT file over the network.
Usually there is no difference to reading it from a local disk.
You can speed it up (even if you were reading from disk) by enabling only the branches that you really need to read.
Well, give it a try!
</div>

<p>Because there are sub-branches in the major branches, you cannot just set the BranchStatus for "muons" - you will have to set it for all the branches under "muons", too.
You can use wildcarding for that.</p>
