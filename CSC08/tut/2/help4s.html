<h1>ROOT Exercise II - Solution</h1>
<p>Got stuck? This is the solution</p>
<h2>1 Reading a TTree</h2>

<div class="exercise">
Looking at the macro you probably saw that it reads the ROOT file over the network.
Usually there is no difference to reading it from a local disk.
You can speed it up (even if you were reading from disk) by enabling only the branches that you really need to read.
Well, give it a try!
</div>

<p>Your the change in the code that selects the branch to read:</p>
<pre>
...
void read_tree()
{
   // function reading particles collection in a tree

   // open the Root file
   TFile *f = new TFile("/var/www/html/ROOT/exercise2.root");
   // get the tree from the file
   TTree *myTree = (TTree*)f-&gt;Get("MyTree");
   <b>// disable all branches 
   myTree-&gt;SetBranchStatus("*", 0);
   // enable only the branch we are interested to read
   myTree-&gt;SetBranchStatus("muons*", 1);</b>
...
</pre>
</body>
