<h1>ROOT Exercise II - Help Level 2</h1>
<p>Got stuck? This might help even more:</p>
<h2>1 Reading a TTree</h2>

<div class="exercise">
Execute <a href="read_tree.C" class="source">read_tree.C<b>+</b></a> (note the plus!).
Modify the macro to read the muons; use the TBrowser to determine the name of the branch.
</div>

<p>The muons are in the branch called "muons", electrons are in the branch called "electrons".
You will need to set the branch address giving the proper branch name.
You can keep the particles' <tt>TClonesArray</tt> variable because both muon and electron branches contain <tt>TClonesArray</tt>s.
And you can even keep the loop over the particles including the histogram filling because both branches contain a <tt>TClonesArray</tt> of <tt>MyParticle</tt>s.</p>
