<h3>Proof</h3>
<ul>
<li>New functionality</li>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;TProofMgr</li>
<ul>
<li>Add support for the following functionality:</li>
<ul>
<li>sandbox file listing and browsing</li>
<li>sandbox file removal</li>
<li>file upload, download</li>
<li>See
http://root.cern.ch/drupal/content/accessing-sandbox for details.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>TProofDraw</li>
<ul>
<li>Allow to set a color, size, size, width for lines,
area, markers; the attributes are transmitted via the input list and
automatically derived from the ones of the chain</li>
</ul>
<li>Support automatic creation of a dataset out of files
created on the worker nodes by worker processes. The implementation is
an extension of the functionality of the class TProofOutputFile used
for merging via file. See
http://root.cern.ch/drupal/content/handling-large-outputs-root-files</li>
</ul>
<li>Improvements</li>
<ul>
<li>TFileMerger</li>
<ul>
<li>A few improvements on the way to make TFileMerger and
hadd totally equivalent:</li>
<ul>
<li>import from hadd an optimization of key hashing</li>
<li>import from hadd a better way to invoke Merge for
generic objects</li>
<li>add option to merge histograms in one go, instead of
one-by-one as for generic objects (this option is not yet supported by
hadd).</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>TProofOutputFile</li>
<ul>
<li>Add support for the placeholded &lt;file&gt;
the definition of the outputfile. This allows to have complete URL and
to pass options to TFile::Open.</li>
</ul>
<li>XrdProofd plugin</li>
<ul>
<li>Add automatically the line 'Path.ForceRemote 1' to the
session rootrc file if the ROOT version is &lt; 5.24/00 ; this acts
as a workaround for the wrong TTreeCache initialization at the
transition between local and remote files fixed in 5.24/00 .</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>Fixes</li>
<ul>
<li>TFileMerger</li>
<ul>
<li>Fix a problem preventing correct transmission of all
non-mergeable objects (fixes bug #52886)</li>
<li>Remove the argument isdir from the function
MergeRecursive</li>
<li>Do not remove the first file in the list when returning
from MergeRecursive (fixes bug #54591)</li>
</ul>
<li>PROOF-Lite</li>
<ul>
<li>Fix a couple of memory leaks showing up when running
repeated queries</li>
<li>Fix a problem in TProofServ::CopyFromCache affecting
the case where the sandbox dir has a '.' and the macro name has no '.',
e.g. compiled selectors in PROOF-Lite.</li>
</ul>
<li>TProofOutputFile</li>
<ul>
<li>Fix a problem with the determination of the fDir member
affecting mostly PROOF-Lite</li>
<li>Fix a serious issue whose net effect was to delete the
outputfile just after having open it</li>
</ul>
<li>XrdProofd plugin</li>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;Make sure that the limit on the number of old
sessions is applied whenever a new session is started and not only when
the daemon is started.</li>
</ul>
<li>DataSet manager</li>
<ul>
<li>Correctly classify as TTree all TTree derived classes
(e.g. TNtuple's)</li>
<li>Fix a problem in saving the end-point URL for local
files</li>
<li>Improve realtime notification during 'verify'</li>
</ul>
<li>TProofDraw</li>
<ul>
<li>Fix a problem with the axis ranges of the underlying
histogram in PolyMarker3D</li>
<li>Allow to use the default pad instead of forcing
creation of one pad per object</li>
<li>Add wrapper to handle the feedback default canvas</li>
</ul>
</ul>
