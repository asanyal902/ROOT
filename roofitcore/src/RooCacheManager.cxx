// -- CLASS DESCRIPTION [AUX] --
// Class RooCacheManager manages a cache for lists of normalization/projection integrals
// for RooAbsPdf objects. Normalization/projection integrals are always defined by to
// RooArgSet pointer containing the set of normalization / projection observables respectively.
//
// For efficiency reasons these pointer are derefenced as little as possible. This
// class contains a lookup table for RooArgSet pointer pairs -> normalization lists.
// Distinct pointer pairs that represent the same normalization/projection are recognized
// and will all point to the same normalization list. Lists for up to 'maxSize' different normalization/
// projection configurations can be cached.
