<h3>Graphical Output</h3>

<h4>PostScript and PDF</h4>
<ul>
<li> The marker size between the screen output and the output file formats
     was not consistant.
</ul>

<h3>Graphics Primitives</h3>

<h4>TLatex</h4>
<ul>
<li> The <tt>#int</tt> and <tt>#sum</tt> symbols had wrong limits placement
     if the character just before started with "#". There was an atempt to fix
     this problem in the previous release but it produced very bad side effects
     therefore the fix was reverted. This new fix does not have this sidecw
     effect. It causes, in the case of the "^" or "_" preceded by "sum" or
     "int", to break off and process everything before "sum" or "int" first.
     After that, when processing the rest, the "^" kicks in first according to
     the order of precedence, and takes the "int" (only!) as its base.

<h4>TGaxis</h4>
<ul>
<li> In case of horizontal axis with the font size in pixel (font precision = 3)
     the labels were not visible.
</ul>

<h4>TPaveStats</h4>
<ul>
<li> The stats painting assumed that the stats position was always defined with
     Y2>Y1 and X2>X1. This is true when the stats is created automatically but 
     might not true if the stats position is given by user. This is now 
     protected. The stats are correctly drawn whatever the orders of X and Y
     coordinates are. 
</ul>

<h4>TCanvas</h4>
<ul> 
<li> In case of <tt>Canvas.MoveOpaque = true</tt> in <tt>$ROOTSYS/etc/system.rootrc</tt>
the rubberband was not visible during the zooming along axis.
</ul>
