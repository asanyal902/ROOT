<ul>
<li> The <tt>#int</tt> and <tt>#sum</tt> symbols had wrong limits placement
     if the character just before started with "#". There was an atempt to fix
     this problem in the previous release but it produced very bad side effects
     therefore the fix was reverted. This new fix does not have this sidecw
     effect. It causes, in the case of the "^" or "_" preceded by "sum" or
     "int", to break off and process everything before "sum" or "int" first.
     After that, when processing the rest, the "^" kicks in first according to
     the order of precedence, and takes the "int" (only!) as its base.
