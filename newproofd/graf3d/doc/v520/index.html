<h3>OpenGL</h3>

<h4>Major changes</h4>

<ul>

<li> Reorganization of scene rendering in TGLViewer - render opaque
objects from all scenes first, then all transparent ones.

<li> Modularization of input event-handling in <tt>TGLViewer</tt>: all
event-handling is done by the <tt>TGLEventHandler</tt> class. One can
sub-class it now and modify behaviour of a given viewer. For
example, see <tt>TEveLegoEventHandler</tt>.

<li> Support highlighting of physical shapes for providing feedback and
showing selection.

</ul>


<h4>Minor changes, fixes and improvements</h4>

<ul>

<li> Improve saving of images from the GL-viewer so that the dialog
boxes and other windows do not result in black areas on the saved
image. The window must still be fully contained within the desktop.

<li> Improved camera controls. Three new orthographic cameras have
been added to <tt>TGLViewer</tt>, looking at the scene from another
side than the one present so far.

<li> Improved FTGL font management across rendering contexts and text
rendering support.

</ul>


<h4>Performance issues with the latest ATI drivers</h4>

In late 2007 ATI switched to a new driver architecture. With these
drivers a significant degradation of GL performance in selection mode,
up to a factor of 50, can be observed. Both linux and Windows drivers
are affected. The best option for the time being is to stay with older
drivers.

<h3>Eve</h3>

<h4>Major changes</h4>

<ul>

<li> Support for multiple, parallel OpenGL views that can show different
projections of the same event.

<li> Provide object selection and feedback highlight across all GL-views and
list-trees.

<li> New classes for visualization of calorimeter data
(<tt>TEveCaloXYZ</tt>, still under development, see
<tt>tutorials/eve/cms_calo.C</tt>. Available representations:
3D-cylindrical view, projected views r-phi and rho-z, and lego-view
(with dedicated event handler allowing detailed and scalable
inspection of the data).

</ul>


<h4>Minor changes, fixes and improvements</h4>

<ul>

<li> Improved handling of projected elements.

<li> For fish-eye projections, allow fixing of compression scale
beyond given distance from the center.

<li> <tt>TEveFrameBox</tt> now supports arbitrary 2d frame shapes -
user specifies individual points via SetQuadByPoints() function.  See
tutorials/eve/quad_test.C::quad_test_circ() for an example.

<li> Consolidation of existing classes and code - Eve is still under rapid
development.

</ul>
