<h1>ROOT Exercise III</h1>
<p>When you are done with today's exercise, you can help your colleagues...</p>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>In this session you will learn how to analyze trees.<p/>
<p>You need to download the code from <a href="../3.tar.bz2">3.tar.bz2</a> and then run</p>
<pre>tar xjf 3.tar.bz2
cd 3</pre>

<p>These are your exercises for this session:</p>
<ol>

  <li class="lvl1">My First TSelector
    <ol>    
      <li><p>We have created a selector (starting from the output of <tt>TTree::MakeSelector()</tt>) for you;
	  see the files <a href="TPosCorr.h" class="source">TPosCorr.h</a> and <a href="TPosCorr.C" class="source">TPosCorr.C</a>.
	  Run it on the TTree MyTree spread over the files</p>
	  <pre>
http://server/ROOT/exercise3.root
http://server/ROOT/exercise3_1.root
http://server/ROOT/exercise3_2.root
http://server/ROOT/exercise3_3.root
http://server/ROOT/exercise3_4.root
http://server/ROOT/exercise3_5.root	  </pre>
	  <p>Run the selector in compiled mode on the whole tree.</p>
      <a href="help11.html" class="help1">HELP!</a></li>

      <li><p>Modify and run the selector to create a histogram of the radius r = sqrt(x^2 + y^2).</p>
      <a href="help21.html" class="help1">HELP!</a></li>
  </ol></li>

  <li class="lvl1">PROOF
    <ol>    
      <li><p>Instead of using only one core of your computer, let's use them all by running the selector in proof lite.</p>
      <a href="help31.html" class="solution">SOLUTION</a></li>

      <li><p>That worked, and it was faster - but it wasn't impressively fast.
	  What about running the same selector on a whole cluster?
	  We have set up a PROOF cluster for you: it uses one core of all the exercise machines.
	  Depending on when you get here the PROOF cluster might be pretty busy or completely empty,
	  and you will get a performance improvement that depends on the available resources.</p>
	  <p>So let's run it! The PROOF master is called <tt>"server"</tt>. Any speed difference?</p>
      <a href="help41.html" class="help1">HELP!</a></li>
	  
      <li><p>That was fast, right? Now let's do it interactively. Quit ROOT and start it again.
	  Simply run <tt>TProof::Open()</tt>. The GUI will allow you to do the same as in the previous exercise.
	  If we told you that the PROOF cluster is broken then create a PROOF lite session with the GUI!
	  Once the selector has run, look at the histograms that are displayed: there are plenty of PROOF statistics like
	  the number of events per node.

  </li>
  <!--
  NO PROXY FOR NOW
  <li class="lvl1">My Second TSelector [OPTIONAL!]
    <ol>
	<li><p>New create your own TSelector - this time we use a different mechanism called Proxy.
	You can create a skeleton proxy-based TSelector from a TTree by calling <tt>TTree::MakeProxy(...)</tt>.
	Modify it so it does what the previous selector did (you may remove the call to Sleep() now ;-).
	This kind of selector is powerful because it determines itself what part of the TTree must be read,
	without the need to specify branches etc.</p>
