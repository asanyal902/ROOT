      <li> <b><em>New TMVA event vector building.</em></b> The code
      for splitting the input data into training and test samples for
      all classes and the mixing of those samples to one training and
      one test sample has been rewritten completely. The new code is
      more performant and has a clearer structure. This should fix
      several bugs which have been reported</li>
