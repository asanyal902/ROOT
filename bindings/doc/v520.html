<P>
There are several improvements in language mappings, as well as cleanup of
the code for python2.2 (Py_ssize_t handling) and MacOS 10.3. Additionally,
there are code cleanups (removing use of CINT internals) that should be
fully transparent to the end-user.
</P>

<P>
The language mapping improvements are:

<UL>
 <LI>Abstract classes can no longer be instantiated (__init__ will raise an exception)</LI>
 <LI>Looping over empty STL(-like) containers will yield an immediate StopIteration</LI>
 <LI>Unknown& is favored over Unknown* in function overloading</LI>
 <LI>Implemented unary-, unary+ (__neg__ and __pos__)</LI>
 <LI>Mapped operator bool() to __nonzero__</LI>
 <LI>Support for templated member functions</LI>
 <LI>Implemented __setitem__ for unsigned int& and unsigned long& returns</LI>
</UL>

</P>
