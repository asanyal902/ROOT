   cd /tmp
   cp -rf  ~/afterstep-stable/libAfterImage .
   cd libAfterImage
   rm -rf apps aftershow config.h
   rm -rf ./libpng/CVS ./CVS ./win32/CVS ./libungif/CVS ./libjpeg/CVS ./zlib/CVS
   cd ..
   tar cvf libAfterImage.tar libAfterImage
   gzip libAfterImage.tar
   cp -f libAfterImage.tar.gz $ROOTSYS/asimage/src
   cd /tmp
   rm -r libAfterImage libAfterImage.tar.gz

Some files have been modified compare to the official libAfterImage version:

   config.h.in has been modified in order to use freetype from the ROOT 
   repository.

   libjpeg/jcmainct.c libjpeg/jdmainct.c have been modified to avoid a 
   compilation warning. These two pieces of code contain a variable called
   "main" (some compiler do not like this). This variable name has been
   changed to "mainptr".

   libjpeg/jmorecfg.h generated a warning on Windows: "a benign redifinition".
   This warning has been disabled.

   "configure" has been modified to look at the ".dylib" file extension to find
   the X11 libraries. This is needed on the Mac Leopard system.
