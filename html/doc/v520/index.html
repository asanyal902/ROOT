<h3>HTML</h3>
<p>THtml now copes with the new directory structure - in fact it can now support any directory structure:
users can implement their own definition of libraries, of where to find sources and how headers are included by means of traits-like objects.
See <a href="http://root.cern.ch/root/html/THtml__THelperBase.html"><tt>THtml::THelperBase</tt></a> for their common base; the derived classes implement customizable functionality.</p>

<p>Some small improvements are THtml's improved <i>Search</i> field in the top box of every page, and the display of methods' signal / menu / etc setting (the new yellow labels in the list of function members).
All generated pages now show the date of the last source modification and the date when the HTML page was last generated.</p>
