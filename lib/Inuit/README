======================================================================
INUIT
A platform independent C++ library for user interfaces on the terminal
======================================================================

1. Purpose:
  libInuit unifies the terminal interaction (input and output) across
  platforms, terminal types, etc. For now it offers an edit line interface
  that will keep a history in the near future. Future extensions will allow
  for menues, windows, and many common widgets (button, toggle, radio, etc).
  For now only keybord input is implemented; in the future, mouse and window
  events (resize etc) will be available, too.
  
2. Design:
  libInuit has a platform independent backend and a set of platform (or even
  terminal) sepcific drivers. Its C++ API is centralized in a small set of
  header files, separated by functionality (drivers, widgets, etc). Several
  example programs show how to use it; you probably want to start with editline.
  To not reimplement the terminal specific drivers for a large amount of
  platforms, libInuit can use the NCurses library where available.

3. Build Instructions:
  Run GNU make or use the solution file for MSVC.

4. License:
  libInuit is far inferior to readline when it comes to functionality. It can
  thus afford to be licensed as MIT/Xfree allowing for widespread use without
  hurting readline's good intent. NCurses is compatible with that. See the
  file called LICENSE for the license.
