<h3>CINT</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Implement new selection #pragma for nested classes. <tt>#pragma link C++ nestedclasses</tt> is needed for CINT to <em>not ignore</em> <tt>#pragma link C++ class A::B</tt>.
  Unlike <tt>#pragma link C++ nestedtypedefs</tt> it does not by itself request dictionaries for nested classes!
  To not break old dictionaries, the latter is now implemented with the following syntax:
  <tt>#pragma link C++ class A::*</tt> will select all classes defined in <tt>A</tt>; CINT does not complain if no nested class is found.
  The selection pragma supports ROOT's flags (trailing '+' etc).
  This feature is now used by the automatic dictionary generator of ROOT, to not only request <tt>vector&lt;T&gt</tt> but also vector&lt;T&gt;::iterator etc.</li>
</ul>
