<h3>CINT</h3>
<ul>
  <li>CINT
  <ul>
    <li>Improve the lookup time for type names. Improves start-up time (dictionary initialization) and parsing speed.</li>
    <li>New link pragma to simply the generation of the dictionary for 'operators' in a rootcint dictionary.
<pre lang=cpp>#pragma link [C++|off] operators classname;</pre>
will turn on/off symbol table registration of the operators that are
declared in the declaring scopes of 'classname' (and any of its enclosing
scope) and take at least one argument that is a reference, pointer, or value argument of type <i>classname</i>.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Reflex
  <ul>
    <li>Implement loading on demand of data and (most) function members for genreflex dictionaries, similar to what is available for rootcint dictionaries. This reduces the start-up time and especially the memory usage of dictionaries considerably.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Cintex
  <ul>
    <li>Fix the implementation of ShowMembers in the case where the members are of type with a rootcint dictionary and no genreflex dictionary.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
