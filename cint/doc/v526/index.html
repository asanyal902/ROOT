<h3>CINT</h3>
<ul>
  <li>CINT
  <ul>
    <li>Improve the lookup time for type names. Improves start-up time (dictionary initialization) and parsing speed.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Reflex
  <ul>
    <li>Implement loading on demand of data and (most) function members for genreflex dictionaries, similar to what is available for rootcint dictionaries. This reduces the start-up time and especially the memory usage of dictionaries considerably.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Cintex
  <ul>
    <li>Fix the implementation of ShowMembers in the case where the members are of type with a rootcint dictionary and no genreflex dictionary.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
