<h3>CINT</h3>
<ul>
<li>Several bug fixes, most notably regarding dictionaries for templated functions, which will now be accessible both as func&lt;int&gt;(int) and func(int).
</li>
<li>Improve support for permanet library (in particular for TSystem::DynFindSymbol.)</li>
<li>Correctly the handle of function parameter type 'reference to bool'.</li>
<li>Fail to match a non-static class member function when called without an object (i.e. typically TString::Form(...)); previously this was allowed and lead to a segfault</li>
<li>port to FreeBSD 7.0</li>
<li>CINT can now autmatically generate dictionary for templated classes, e.g. A&lt;B&gt; if the header file for A and B is known.
This allows to interpret vector&lt;MyClass&gt; by transparently generating a
dictionary for it. This feature can be toggeled on or off by ".autodict".</li>
</ul>
<h4>Reflex</h4>
<ul>
<li>GCCXML 0.6 is not supported anymore.</li>
</ul>
