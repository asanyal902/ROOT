CMake:
Test on all platforms with all permutations

Nice to have:
Figure out a way to stop generating pyc files in source dir
make test should make if not already done
Determine which FIND_PACKAGE statements are unneeded and move to more restricted scope when possible
Add a feature to PosixFeatures.cmake stating that it 'needs dl' and test that when linking with dl
GCCXML and PythonInterp are currently optional, they should be enforced
create a FindReflex module for use by others
