This is an initial version of the RooStats users guide.

The goal is to make this somewhat automated, hence the use of a Makefile.
Ideally, the examples in the tex file come from macros directly 
and those macros also produce the pdfs and .dot files used to visualize 
the models.

To run it you need latex, pdftex, and some extensions.

dot2tex for generating the graphs to represent models.  For information about installing see:
	http://www.tex.ac.uk/tex-archive/graphics/dot2tex/dot2tex.pdf
	http://www.fauskes.net/code/dot2tex/

textcomp for styling the code (.sty file included)

to build the users guide, type 
   make

Note: Right now you have to hit .q to exit out of root when the macros are done being processed (how do we avoid that?).  Also, I get some errors in pdfex, so I have to hit <ENTER> a few times for it to complete.  But it looks fine.  If anyone can fix that, it would be great.  --Kyle
