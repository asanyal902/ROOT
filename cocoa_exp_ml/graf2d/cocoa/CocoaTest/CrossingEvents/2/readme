Leave/Enter notify events without grabs.

test1.gui:

Pointer moves from window A to window B and A is an inferior of B:

-LeaveNotify with detail Ancestor is generated on A
-LeaveNotify with detail Virtual is generated on each window between A and B exclusive (in that order)
-EnterNotify with detail Inferior is generated on B


GUI: one main window with several nested windows, pointer must go from some of nested windows
to it's parents:

main window 500, 500, 600, 600
|
child window 100, 100, 400, 400
  |
child window 50, 50, 350, 300
   |
child window 25, 25, 325, 250

Expected output - messages from TestFrame::HandleCrossing, with event types and coordinates (use window geometry
to visually check, if coordinates are OK).

Compare Cocoa/X11 versions, compare coordinates.
