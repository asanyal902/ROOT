Test implicit grab initialization.
Test gui has 3 windows, child window 6 has the same size
as its parent (window with id 5), only window 5 has
kButtonPressMask/kButtonReleaseMask, so if you press mouse
button while cursor is inside window 6, window 5 should receive
button press/release events (even if you move cursor out of
window 6/5 completely after you press button (before release)).
