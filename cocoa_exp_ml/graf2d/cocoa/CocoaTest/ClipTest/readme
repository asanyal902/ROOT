Clipping algorithm tests.

As I do not have per-view backing store (only per-top-level-window), I have to emulate
standard window behaviour: if some overlapped window is repainted, overlapped parts
should not be touched.

TEST1-TEST5 - only children are tested.

TEST1:

Parent window (id == 4) has mouse press mask, on mouse event it calls
gClient->NeedRedraw(this), so this window is repainted 
(I'm randomly changing background colour to make this visible).
But children window (id == 5) is not touched by this repaint.

TEST2:

Parent window (4) has two children (5, 6). 5 completely overlaps 4, 6 is overlapping 5 (and 4). On mouse click you can only see messages in a console, nothing is repainted
(4's visible area is empty).

TEST3:

The same as TEST2, but small part of window 5 is visible on the right.

TEST4:

The same as TEST3, but not window 6 overlaps only part of window 5 (and overlap with 4 is visible). Updated regions - two rectangles on the right.

TEST5:

Window 5 and 6 (children of 4) overlaps completely two bands in a window 4 (making a
 "cross").

TEST6:

Window id==4 has 4 children.
