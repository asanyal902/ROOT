INTRODUCTION
------------

This is a job submission framework for TMVA.  It can be used to make
parameter scans of TMVA classifiers using a batch system like LSF
Batch.

USAGE
-----

Step 1:

At first you have to modify the 'makefile' and set your TMVA
directory.  Then you should compile the job file using

$ make

Step 2:

The file to proceed with is 'scan.py'.  Here you can specify the
classifier and the parameters (and ranges) to scan.  When executing

$ ./scan.py

a set of jobs is created and submitted to the batch system (which also
can be specified in 'scan.py').  Each job writes additional classifier
output to a shared text file, which later can be easily used to make
plots (e.g. using awk and gnuplot).

FILES
-----

analysis.cxx - The job program, which books the classifier and writes
               the output files to the in 'scan.py' specified location.

makefile - Used to compile 'analysis.cxx'.  The location of your TMVA
           directory must be specified here!

scan.py - The job submission script.  The method to book and the
          parameters to scan over are set here.  This file must be
          made executable via

          $ chmod +x scan.py

          By executing

          $ ./scan.py

          all jobs are submitted to the batch system.

vary.py - This file contains helper functions used for parsing the
          method's option string.
