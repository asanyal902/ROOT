to run the test from scratch using a standalone TMVA directory do the following

#create standlone tmva directory
svn co https://root.cern.ch/svn/root/trunk/tmva
#create unit testsuite
svn co https://root.cern.ch/svn/root/branches/dev/tmvaValidation/testsuite
cd tmva
make
cd test
# this source setup.sh is important for the compilation of the unit test
source setup.sh
cd ../../testsuite
make -f Makefile.standalone
./stressTMVA

# alternatively you can do the following, which allows you to test any TMVA directory that you are working on

export TMVASYS=<TMVA directory of your choice>
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$TMVASYS/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
cd testsuite
make [FULL=1] [DEBUG=1]

FULL=1 runs all tests (~30 min), by default it runs the short version (~2 min)
DEBUG=1 enables debugging output, by default the tests are silent

-------------------------------------------------------------------

# Independent Test of the TMVA standalone classes
# after the full stresstest, run the script testMakeClass.sh
./testMakeClass.sh
next compile the executable, adding . to the include path

alternatively one can use the makefile
./stressTMVA
make -f Makefile.standalone makeclasstest
